Some word lists that aren't in the dariusk/corpora module.

Most of these lists are lists of words sorted by frequency of
occurance in English. In general, these word lists are too large to
fit in corpora. Most of them have been manually edited to minimize the
risk of embarrassing or offensive output. (But it's ultimately up to
you.)

* abstract_nouns.txt - The 4000 most common abstract concepts, like
  "work" and "love".

* adjectival_nouns.txt - The top 1000 nouns that can also act as
  adjectives.

* adjectives.txt - The 5000 most common adjectives.

* concrete_nouns.txt - The opposite of abstract_nouns.txt. These nouns
  refer to more concrete things like "hometown" and
  "masterpiece". (But see scribblenauts_words.txt to get even more
  concrete.)

* gerunds.txt - The 3000 most common gerunds.

* past_tense.txt - The 3000 most common past tense verbs.

* present_tense.txt - The 2000 most common present tense verbs.

* scribblenauts_words.txt - The top 4000 nouns that were 'concrete'
  enough to be summonable in the game Scribblenauts.

We also have some more corpora-type JSON datasets:

* large_cities.json - Large U.S. and world cities
* languages.json - ISO-639-1 languages
* stopwords.json - Stopwords as defined by MySQL
* us_states.json - U.S. states (just the 50)
