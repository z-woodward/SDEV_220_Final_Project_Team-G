JOHN ADCOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n  WITH SEVENTY-FOUR ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n  BY FREDERICK ADCOCK\r\n  AND 16 PORTRAITS\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON: J. M. DENT & SONS, LTD.\r\n  NEW YORK: E. P. DUTTON & CO. 1912\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _All rights reserved_\r\n\r\n  Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\n  At the Ballantyne Press, Edinburgh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could well be deader or emptier than an unoccupied house of whose\r\nformer inhabitants we have no knowledge; and it is impossible to take a\r\nreal interest in a house now occupied by strangers, even though it was\r\naforetime the residence of some famous man, unless we are acquainted with\r\nthat man's personality, and know what he thought and did and said whilst\r\nhe was living there. I have attempted to do little more than supply that\r\ninformation here as the complement of my brother's drawings, and to this\r\nend have been less concerned to give my own descriptions and opinions than\r\nto bring together opinions and descriptions that were written by such\r\nfamous residents themselves or by guests and visitors who saw and knew\r\nthem. As far as possible I have quoted from contemporary Diaries and\r\nMemoirs, especially from letters that were written in or to these houses,\r\nor from Journals that their tenants kept whilst they dwelt there,\r\nsupplementing all this with a narrative of incidents and events that might\r\nhelp to recreate the life and recapture the atmosphere that belonged to\r\nsuch places in the days that have made them memorable. Whenever I have\r\nadventured into any general biography, or expressed any personal opinion,\r\nit has been merely with the object of adding so much of history and\r\ncharacter as would serve to fill in the outline of a man's portrait, give\r\nit a sufficient fulness and colour of life, and throw into clear relief\r\nthe space of time that he passed in some particular house that can still\r\nbe seen in a London street.\r\n\r\nI think I have throughout made due acknowledgment to the authors of\r\nvarious volumes of _Recollections_ and _Table Talk_ from which I have\r\ndrawn anecdotes and pen-portraits, and I should like to mention at the\r\noutset that for biographical facts and much else I have been particularly\r\nindebted to such books as Elwin and Courthope's edition of the _Poems and\r\nLetters of Pope_; Austin Dobson's _William Hogarth_, and H. B. Wheatley's\r\n_Hogarth's London_; Boswell's _Johnson_, of course, and Forster's _Lives\r\nof Goldsmith_ and of _Dickens_; Gilchrist's _Life of Blake_; Leslie's and\r\nHolmes's _Lives of Constable_; Arthur B. Chamberlain's _George Romney_;\r\nLord Houghton's _Life and Letters of Keats_, and Buxton Forman's _Complete\r\nWorks of John Keats_; Leigh Hunt's _Autobiography_; De Quincey's _English\r\nOpium Eater_; Hogg's and Peacock's _Memoirs of Shelley_; Carew Hazlitt's\r\n_Memoirs of Hazlitt_; Blackman's _Life of Day_; Byron's _Journals and\r\nLetters_, and Lewis Bettany's useful compilation from them, _The\r\nConfessions of Lord Byron_; Lockhart's _Life of Scott_, and Scott's\r\n_Journal_; Talfourd's and Ainger's _Lives of Lamb_, and Lamb's _Letters_;\r\nWalter Jerrold's _Life of Thomas Hood_; Cross's _Life of George Eliot_;\r\nSir William Armstrong's _Life of Turner_, and Lewis Hind's _Turner's\r\nGolden Visions_; Joseph Knight's _Rossetti_; Froude's _Thomas Carlyle_,\r\nand W. H. Wylie's _Carlyle, The Man and His Books_; Allingham's _Diary_;\r\nE. R. and J. Pennell's _Life of Whistler_; Trollope's _Thackeray_, and\r\nLady Thackeray Ritchie's prefaces to the Centenary Edition of Thackeray's\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nA. ST. J.

SAVIOUR'S. SOUTHWARK CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMOUS LONDON HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSOME CELEBRATED COCKNEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou cannot stir the ground of London anywhere but straightway it flowers\r\ninto romance. Read the inscriptions on the crumbling tombs of our early\r\nmerchant princes and adventurers in some of the old City churches, and it\r\nglimmers upon you that if ever the history of London's commercial rise and\r\nprogress gets adequately written it will read like a series of stories out\r\nof the _Arabian Nights_. Think what dashing and magnificent figures, what\r\ntales of dark plottings, fierce warfare, and glorious heroisms must\r\nbrighten and darken the pages of any political history of London; and even\r\nmore glamorous, more intensely and humanly alive, would be a social\r\nhistory of London, beginning perhaps in those days of the fourteenth\r\ncentury when Langland was living in Cornhill and writing his _Vision of\r\nPiers Plowman_, or farther back still, in Richard the First's time, when\r\nthat fine spirit, the first of English demagogues, William Fitzosbert, was\r\nharanguing the folkmoot in St. Paul's Churchyard, urging them to resist\r\nthe tyrannic taxations of the Lord Mayor and his Court of wealthy\r\nAldermen--a passion for justice that brought him into such danger that he\r\nand certain of his friends had to seek sanctuary, and barricaded\r\nthemselves in Bow Church. The church was fired by order of a bishop who\r\nhad no sympathy with reformers, and Fitzosbert and his friends, breaking\r\nout through the flames, were stabbed and struck down in Cheapside, hustled\r\nto the Tower, hastily tried and sentenced, dragged out by the heels\r\nthrough the streets, and hanged at Smithfield. I have always thought this\r\nwould make a good, live starting-point, and had I but world enough and\r\ntime I would sooner write that history than anything else.\r\n\r\nNo need to hunt after topics when you are writing about London; they come\r\nto you. The air is full of them. The very names of the streets are\r\ncabalistic words. Once you know London, myriads of great spirits may be\r\ncalled from the vasty deep by sight or sound of such names as Fleet\r\nStreet, Strand, Whitehall, Drury Lane, The Temple, Newgate Street,\r\nAldersgate, Lombard Street, Cloth Fair, Paternoster Row, Holborn,\r\nBishopsgate, and a hundred others. You have only to walk into Whitefriars\r\nStreet and see \"Hanging-sword Alley\" inscribed on the wall of a court at\r\nthe top of a narrow flight of steps, and all Alsatia rises again around\r\nyou, as Ilion rose like a mist to the music of Apollo's playing. Loiter\r\nalong Cornhill in the right mood and Thomas Archer's house shall rebuild\r\nitself for you at the corner of Pope's Head Alley, where he started the\r\nfirst English newspaper in 1603, and you will wonder why nobody writes a\r\nfull history of London journalism.\r\n\r\nAs for literary London--every other street you traverse is haunted with\r\nmemories of poets, novelists, and men of letters, and it is some of the\r\nobscurest of these associations that are the most curiously fascinating. I\r\nhave a vivid, youthful remembrance of a tumble-down, red-tiled shop near\r\nthe end of Leathersellers' Buildings which I satisfied myself was the\r\nidentical place in which Robert Bloomfield worked as a shoemaker's\r\nassistant; Devereux Court still retains something of the Grecian\r\nCoffee-house that used to be frequented by Addison and Steele, but I knew\r\nthe Court first, and am still drawn to it most, as the site of that\r\nvanished Tom's Coffee-house where Akenside often spent his winter\r\nevenings; and if I had my choice of bringing visibly back out of\r\nnothingness one of the old Charing Cross houses, it would be the butcher's\r\nshop that was kept by the uncle who adopted Prior in his boyhood.\r\n\r\nPlenty of unpleasant things have been said about London, but never by her\r\nown children, or such children of her adoption as Johnson and Dickens.\r\nSays Hobbes, who was born at Malmesbury, \"London has a great belly, but no\r\npalate,\" and Bishop Stubbs (a native of Knaresborough) more recently\r\ndescribed it as \"always the purse, seldom the head, and never the heart of\r\nEngland.\" Later still an eminent speaker, quoting this fantastic dictum of\r\nStubbs's, went a step further and informed his audience that \"not many men\r\neminent in literature have been born in London\"; a statement so\r\ndemonstrably inaccurate that one may safely undertake to show that at\r\nleast as many men eminent in literature, to say nothing of art and\r\nscience, have been born in London as in any other half-dozen towns of the\r\nkingdom put together.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the morning star of our literature, Geoffrey Chaucer, was\r\nborn in Thames Street, not far from the wharf where, after he was married\r\nand had leased a home for himself in Aldgate, he held office as a\r\nComptroller of Customs, and the pen that was presently to write the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_ \"moved over bills of lading.\" The \"poets' poet,\"\r\nSpenser, was born in East Smithfield, by the Tower, and in his\r\n_Prothalamion_ speaks of his birthplace affectionately as--\r\n\r\n  \"Merry London, my most kindly nurse,\r\n   That to me gave this life's first native source,\r\n   Though from another place I take my name.\"\r\n\r\nBen Jonson was born in Hartshorn Lane, Charing Cross; four of his\r\ncontemporary dramatists, Fletcher, Webster, Shirley and Middleton, were\r\nalso Londoners by birth; Sir Thomas Browne, author of the _Religio\r\nMedici_, was born in the parish of St. Michael-le-Quern, in the very heart\r\nof the city; and Bread Street, Cheapside, is hallowed by the fact that\r\nMilton had his birth there.\r\n\r\nDr. Donne, the son of a London merchant, was also born within a stone's\r\nthrow of Cheapside; and his disciple, Cowley, came into the world in Fleet\r\nStreet, at the corner of Chancery Lane. But Cowley was a renegade; he\r\nacquired an unnatural preference for the country, and not only held that\r\n\"God the first garden made, and the first city Cain,\" but ended a poem in\r\npraise of nature and a quiet life with--\r\n\r\n              \"Methinks I see\r\n  The monster London laugh at me;\r\n    I should at thee too, foolish city,\r\n  If it were fit to laugh at misery;\r\n    But thy estate I pity.\r\n  Let but thy wicked men from out thee go,\r\n  And all the fools that crowd thee so,\r\n    Even thou, who dost thy millions boast,\r\n  A village less than Islington wilt grow,\r\n    A solitude almost.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN MILTON]\r\n\r\nThe daintiest of our lyrists, Herrick, was born over his father's shop in\r\nCheapside, and you may take it he was only playing with poetical fancies\r\nwhen, in some lines to his friend Endymion Porter, he praised the country\r\nwith its \"nut-brown mirth and russet wit,\" and again when, in a set of\r\nverses on \"The Country Life,\" he assured his brother he was \"thrice and\r\nabove blest,\" because he could--\r\n\r\n  \"Leave the city, for exchange, to see\r\n   The country's sweet simplicity.\"\r\n\r\nIf you want to find him in earnest, turn to that enraptured outburst of\r\nhis on \"His Return to London\"--\r\n\r\n  \"Ravished in spirit I come, nay more I fly\r\n   To thee, blessed place of my nativity!...\r\n   O place! O people! manners framed to please\r\n   All nations, customs, kindreds, languages!\r\n   I am a free-born Roman; suffer then\r\n   That I amongst you live a citizen.\r\n   London my home is, though by hard fate sent\r\n   Into a long and irksome banishment;\r\n   Yet since called back, henceforward let me be,\r\n   O native country! repossessed by thee;\r\n   For rather than I'll to the West return,\r\n   I'll beg of thee first here to have mine urn.\"\r\n\r\nThere speaks the true Cockney; he would sooner be dead in London than\r\nalive in the West of England. Even Lamb's love of London was scarcely\r\ngreater than that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATEWAY. MIDDLE TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nIt was fitting that Pope, essentially a town poet, should be born in\r\nLombard Street. In the next thoroughfare, Cornhill, Gray was born; and,\r\nson of a butcher, Defoe began life in the parish of St. Giles's,\r\nCripplegate. Shakespeare was an alien, but Bacon was born at York House,\r\nin the Strand; which, to my thinking, is the strongest argument in favour\r\nof the theory that he wrote the plays. Churchill was born at Vine Street,\r\nWestminster; Keats in Moorfields; and, staunchest and one of the most\r\nincorrigible Londoners of them all, Charles Lamb in Crown Office Row,\r\nTemple. He refers, in one of his essays, to Hare Court, in the Temple, and\r\nsays: \"It was a gloomy, churchyard-like court, with three trees and a\r\npump in it. I was born near it, and used to drink at that pump when I was\r\na Rechabite of six years old.\" The pump is no longer there, only one half\r\nof Hare Court remains as it was in Lamb's day, and Crown Office Row has\r\nbeen rebuilt. His homes in Mitre Court Buildings and Inner Temple Lane\r\nhave vanished also; but the Temple is still rich in reminiscences of him.\r\nPaper Buildings, King's Bench Walk, Harcourt Buildings, the fountain near\r\nGarden Court, the old Elizabethan Hall, in which tradition says\r\nShakespeare read one of his plays to Queen Elizabeth--these and the\r\nchurch, the gardens, the winding lanes and quaint byways of the Temple,\r\nmade up, as he said, his earliest recollections. \"I repeat to this day,\"\r\nhe writes, \"no verses to myself more frequently, or with kindlier emotion,\r\nthan those of Spenser, where he speaks of this spot--\r\n\r\n  'There when they came whereas those bricky towers\r\n   The which on Themmes broad aged back doth ride,\r\n   Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,\r\n   There whylome wont the Templar knights to bide,\r\n   Till they decayed through pride.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd, \"indeed,\" he adds, \"it is the most elegant spot in the metropolis.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAUCER'S TOMB. WESTMINSTER ABBEY.]\r\n\r\nBut his letters and essays are full of his love of London. \"I don't care\r\nmuch,\" he wrote to Wordsworth, \"if I never see a mountain. I have passed\r\nall my days in London, until I have formed as many and intense local\r\nattachments as any of your mountaineers can have done with dead Nature....\r\nI often shed tears in the motley Strand from fulness of joy in so much\r\nlife.\" Again, \"Fleet Street and the Strand,\" he writes to Manning, \"are\r\nbetter places to live in for good and all than amidst Skiddaw.\" After he\r\nhad removed to Edmonton, on account of his sister's health, it was to\r\nWordsworth he wrote, saying how he pined to be back again in London: \"In\r\ndreams I am in Fleet Market, but I wake and cry to sleep again.... Oh,\r\nnever let the lying poets be believed who 'tice men from the cheerful\r\nhaunts of streets.... A garden was the primitive prison, till man, with\r\nPromethean felicity and boldness, luckily sinned himself out of it. Thence\r\nfollowed Babylon, Nineveh, Venice, London.... I would live in London\r\nshirtless, bookless.\"\r\n\r\nBut to get back to our catalogue of birthplaces--Blake was born in Broad\r\nStreet, near Golden Square; Byron in Holles Street; Hood in the Poultry,\r\nwithin sight of the Mansion House; Dante and Christina Rossetti were\r\nLondoners born; so were Swinburne, Browning, Philip Bourke Marston, John\r\nStuart Mill, Ruskin, Turner, Holman Hunt, Sir Arthur Sullivan--but if we\r\ngo outside literary Londoners this chapter will end only with the book.\r\nMoreover, my purpose is not so much to talk of authors and artists who\r\nwere born in London, as to give some record of the still surviving houses\r\nin which many of them lived; whether they had their birth here or not, the\r\nmajority of them came here to live and work, for, so far as England is\r\nconcerned, there is more than a grain of truth in Lamb's enthusiastic\r\nboast that \"London is the only fostering soil of genius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE IN LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London that Shakespeare knew has vanished like a dream. The Great Fire\r\nswept most of it out of existence in a few days of 1666, and the two and a\r\nhalf centuries of time since then have made away with nearly all the rest\r\nof it. The Tower still remains; there are parts of the Temple; a stray\r\nrelic or so, such as the London Stone in Cannon Street, by which\r\nShakespeare lays one of the Jack Cade scenes of his _Henry VI._ There are\r\nthe stately water-gates along the Embankment, too; here and there an old\r\nhouse or so, such as that above the Inner Temple gateway, those of Staple\r\nInn, those in Cloth Fair, and over in the Borough High Street; a few\r\nancient Inns, like the Mitre off Ely Place, the Dick Whittington in Cloth\r\nFair, the George in Southwark; some dozen of churches, including\r\nWestminster Abbey (in whose Jerusalem Chamber the translators of the Bible\r\nheld their meetings), St. Saviour's, Southwark, St. Bartholomew the Great\r\nin Smithfield, St. Andrew Undershaft, St. Ethelburga's and St. Helen's,\r\nBishopsgate, in which latter parish it seems probable that Shakespeare was\r\nfor a while a householder; otherwise Elizabethan London has dwindled to\r\nlittle but remembered sites of once-famous buildings and streets that have\r\nchanged in everything but their names.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERUSALEM CHAMBER. WESTMINSTER ABBEY.]\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently none of us knew of any address in London that had\r\never been Shakespeare's; we knew of no house, of no street even, which had\r\nonce numbered him among its tenants, though we know that he passed at\r\nleast twenty of the busiest and most momentous years of his life in the\r\nmetropolis. There is a plausible but vague tradition that during some part\r\nof that period he had lodgings in Southwark near the Globe Theatre, in\r\nwhich he acted, for which he wrote plays, and of which he was one of the\r\nproprietors. There used to be an inscription: \"Here lived William\r\nShakespeare,\" on the face of an old gabled house in Aldersgate Street, but\r\nthere was never a rag of evidence to support the statement. We have no\r\nletters of Shakespeare, but we have one or two that refer to him, and one\r\nwritten to him by Richard Quiney, and I think we may infer from this\r\nlatter that Shakespeare occasionally visited Quiney, who was a vintner,\r\ndwelling at the sign of the Bell in Carter Lane. Otherwise, except for a\r\nhandful of small-beer chronicles about him that were picked up in\r\ntheatrical circles two or three generations after his death, we had no\r\nrecord of any incident in his London life that brought us into actual\r\npersonal touch with him until little more than two years ago. Then an\r\nAmerican professor, Mr. Charles William Wallace, came over and did what\r\nour English students do not appear to have had the energy or enterprise to\r\ndo for themselves--he toiled carefully through the dusty piles of\r\ndocuments preserved in the Record Office, and succeeded in unearthing one\r\nof the most interesting Shakespearean discoveries that have ever been\r\nmade--a discovery that gives us vividly intimate glimpses of Shakespeare's\r\nlife in London, and establishes beyond question his place of residence\r\nhere in the years when he was writing some of the greatest of his dramas.\r\n\r\nIn 1587 the company of the \"Queen's Players\" made their first appearance\r\nin Stratford-on-Avon, and it was about this date, so far as can be traced,\r\nthat Shakespeare ran away from home; so you may reasonably play with a\r\nfancy that he joined this company in some very minor capacity and\r\ntravelled with them to London. At this time, Burbage, who was by\r\nprofession an actor and by trade a carpenter and joiner, was owner and\r\nmanager of \"The Theatre,\" which stood in Shoreditch near the site of the\r\npresent Standard Theatre, and close by was a rival house, \"The Curtain\"\r\n(commemorated nowadays by Curtain Road); and according to the legend,\r\nwhich has developed into a legend of exact detail, yet rests on nothing\r\nbut the airiest rumour, it was outside one or both of these theatres\r\nShakespeare picked up a living on his arrival in London by minding horses\r\nwhilst their owners were inside witnessing a performance.\r\n\r\nBy 1593 Shakespeare had become known as an actor and as a dramatist. He\r\nhad revised and tinkered at various plays for Burbage's company, and as a\r\nconsequence had been charged with plagiarism by poor Greene, whose\r\n_Groatsworth of Wit_ (published after he had died miserably in Dowgate)\r\npours scorn on the \"upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with\r\nhis _Tygers heart wrapt in a players hide_ supposes he is as well able to\r\nbumbast out a blank verse as the best of you; and being an absolute\r\n_Johannes fac totum_, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a\r\ncountrie.\" For his acting, Shakespeare appears for the first time in the\r\nLord Chamberlain's accounts of 1594 as having taken equal shares with\r\nWilliam Kemp and Richard Burbage in a sum of twenty pounds \"for two\r\nseverall Comedies or Interludes shewed by them\" before Queen Elizabeth at\r\nChristmas 1593.\r\n\r\nAfter the Theatre of Shoreditch was pulled down in 1598, Burbage built the\r\nGlobe Theatre on Bankside, Southwark, on the ground of which part of\r\nBarclay & Perkins's brewery now stands; and Shakespeare, \"being a\r\ndeserveing man,\" was taken as one of the partners and received a\r\n\"chief-actor's share\" of the profits. And it is to this prosperous period\r\nof his London career that Professor Wallace's recent discoveries belong.\r\n\r\nIn 1598 there lived in a shop at the corner of Silver Street and Monkwell\r\nStreet a certain Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of wigs and fashionable\r\nheaddresses. He was a Frenchman, born at Cressy, and probably a refugee\r\nHuguenot. His household consisted of a wife and daughter, an apprentice\r\nnamed Stephen Bellott, and one lodger, and this lodger was William\r\nShakespeare. Being out of his apprenticeship in 1604, Stephen had six\r\npounds from his master and, with this and his own savings, went travelling\r\ninto Spain, but returned towards the end of the year and resumed work\r\nagain at Mountjoy's shop. In his 'prentice days Stephen seems to have\r\nformed some shy attachment to his master's daughter, Mary, but because of\r\nhis lack of means and prospects, or because he was naturally reticent, he\r\nhad made no attempt to press his suit, and Madame Mountjoy, seeing how the\r\nyoung people were affected to each other, followed the fashion of the time\r\nand persuaded Shakespeare, who had then been living under the same roof\r\nwith them for six years, to act as match-maker between her and the\r\nhesitating lover. She one day laid the case before Shakespeare and asked\r\nhis good offices, as Professor Wallace has it; she told him that \"if he\r\ncould bring the young man to make a proposal of marriage, a dower fitting\r\nto their station should be settled upon them at marriage. This was the\r\nsum of fifty pounds in money of that time, or approximately four hundred\r\npounds in money of to-day.\" Shakespeare consented to undertake this\r\ndelicate duty; he spoke with young Bellott, and the outcome of his\r\nnegotiations was that Stephen and Mary were married, as the entry in the\r\nchurch register shows, at St. Olave, Silver Street, on the 19th November\r\n1604.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Madame Mountjoy in 1606, Stephen and his wife went back to\r\nlive with the father and help him in his business, but they soon fell out\r\nwith him, and became on such bad terms that some six months later they\r\nleft him and took lodgings with George Wilkins, a victualler, who kept an\r\ninn in the parish of St. Sepulchre's. The quarrel between them culminated\r\nin Stephen Bellott bringing an action in the Court of Requests in 1612, to\r\nrecover from his father-in-law a promised dower of sixty pounds and to\r\nensure that Mountjoy carried out an alleged arrangement to bequeath a sum\r\nof two hundred pounds to him by his will. At the Record Office Professor\r\nWallace found all the legal documents relating to these proceedings, and\r\namongst them are the depositions of Shakespeare setting forth to the best\r\nof his recollection his own share in the arranging of the marriage. From\r\nthese depositions, and from those of other witnesses who make reference to\r\nhim, one gets the first clear and authentic revelation of Shakespeare's\r\nhome life in London.\r\n\r\nHe lived with the Mountjoys over that shop at the corner of Monkwell\r\nStreet for at least six years, down to the date of the wedding, and there\r\nis little doubt that he stayed on with them after that. It is more than\r\nlikely, indeed, that he was still boarding there when he appeared as a\r\nwitness in the 1612 lawsuit and stated that he had been intimate with the\r\nfamily some \"ten years, more or less.\" Throughout the later of those years\r\nhe was absent on occasional visits to Stratford, and hitherto it has been\r\ngenerally assumed (on the negative evidence that no trace of him could be\r\nfound after this date) that he returned and settled down in Stratford\r\npermanently about 1609.\r\n\r\nTaking only the six years we are certain of, however, he wrote between\r\n1598 and 1604 _Henry V._, _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, _Much Ado About\r\nNothing_, _As You Like It_, _Twelfth Night_, _All's Well that Ends Well_,\r\n_Julius C\u00e6sar_, _Hamlet_, _Measure for Measure_, and _Othello_. In the two\r\nyears following, whilst it is pretty sure he was still dwelling with the\r\nMountjoys, he wrote _Macbeth_ and _King Lear_, and the fact that he had\r\nhis home here during the period in which he was writing ten of his\r\nplays--three of them amongst the greatest he or any man ever wrote--makes\r\nthis corner of Monkwell Street the most glorious literary landmark in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE]\r\n\r\nThe house in which he lodged was destroyed by the Great Fire, and the site\r\nis occupied now by an old tavern, \"The Cooper's Arms.\" Almost facing it,\r\njust the other side of Silver Street, is a fragment of the churchyard of\r\nSt. Olave's. The church, in which the apprentice Stephen was married to\r\nMary Mountjoy, vanished also in the Great Fire and was not rebuilt, and\r\nthis weedy remnant of the churchyard with its three or four crumbling\r\ntombs is all that survives of the street as Shakespeare knew it; his\r\nglance must have rested on that forlorn garden of the dead as often as\r\nhe looked from the windows opposite or came out at Mountjoy's door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. OLAVE'S CHURCHYARD. SILVER STREET.]\r\n\r\nTurning to the right when he came out at that door, half a minute's walk\r\nup Falcon Street would have brought him into Aldersgate Street, so the\r\nannouncement on one of the shops there that he had lived in it may have\r\nbeen nothing worse than a perfectly honest mistake; it was known as a fact\r\nthat he lived thereabouts, and tradition settled on the wrong house\r\ninstead of on the right one, that was a hundred yards or so away from it.\r\nBut when Shakespeare issued from Mountjoy's shop you may depend that his\r\nfeet more frequently trod the ground in the opposite direction; he would\r\ngo to the left, along Silver Street, into Wood Street, and down the length\r\nof that to Cheapside, where, almost fronting the end of Wood Street,\r\nstood the Mermaid Tavern, and he must needs pass to the right or left of\r\nit, by way of Friday Street, or Bread Street, across Cannon Street and\r\nthen down Huggin Lane or Little Bread Street Hill to Thames Street,\r\nwhence, from Queenhithe, Puddle Wharf, or Paul's Wharf, he could take boat\r\nover the Thames to the Globe Theatre on Bankside.\r\n\r\nThere has been no theatre on Bankside these many years; there is nothing\r\nthere or in that vicinity now that belongs to Shakespeare's age except\r\nsome scattered, ancient, inglorious houses that he may or may not have\r\nknown and the stately cathedral of St. Saviour. This holds still the span\r\nof ground that has belonged to it since before Chaucer's day. You may\r\nenter and see there the quaint effigy of Chaucer's contemporary, Gower,\r\nsleeping on his five-century-old tomb; and here and there about the aisles\r\nand in the nave are memorials of remembered or forgotten men and women who\r\ndied while Shakespeare was living, and somewhere in it were buried men,\r\ntoo, who were intimate with him, though no evidence of their burial there\r\nremains except in the parish register. In the \"monthly accounts\" of St.\r\nSaviour's you come upon these entries concerning two of his contemporary\r\ndramatists:--\r\n\r\n    \"1625. _August_ 29th, John Fletcher, a poet, in the church.\"\r\n\r\n    \"1638. _March_ 18th, Philip Massinger, stranger, in the church.\"\r\n\r\nthe inference being that Fletcher had resided in the parish, and\r\nMassinger, the \"stranger,\" had not. But earlier than either of these, it\r\nis on record that on the 31st December 1607, Shakespeare's youngest\r\nbrother, Edmund, \"a player,\" was buried here, and a fee of twenty\r\nshillings was paid by some one for \"a forenoon knell of the great bell.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Saviour's, then, the sites of the Globe Theatre and the Mermaid, and\r\nthat corner of Monkwell Street are London's chief Shakespearean shrines.\r\nThe discovery of the Monkwell Street residence emphasises that before Ben\r\nJonson founded his Apollo Club at the Devil Tavern by Temple Bar,\r\nCheapside and not Fleet Street was the heart of literary London. Whilst\r\nShakespeare made his home with the Mountjoys, Ben Jonson and Dekker were\r\nliving near him in Cripplegate, in which district also resided Johnson the\r\nactor, Anthony Munday, and other of Shakespeare's intimates; nearer still,\r\nin Aldermanbury, lived Heminges and Condell, his brother actors, who first\r\ncollected and published his plays after his death: and George Wilkins, at\r\nwhose inn near St. Sepulchre's Stephen Bellott and his wife lodged after\r\ntheir quarrel with Mountjoy, was a minor dramatist who, besides\r\ncollaborating with Rowley, collaborated with Shakespeare himself in the\r\nwriting of _Pericles_. Coryat, the eccentric author of the _Crudities_,\r\nlived in Bow Lane; Donne, who was born in Wood Street, wrote his early\r\npoems there in the house of the good merchant, his father, and was a\r\nfrequenter of the Mermaid.\r\n\r\nIn 1608 Milton was born in Bread Street (Shakespeare must have passed his\r\ndoor many a time in his goings to and fro), and grew up to live and work\r\nwithin the City walls in Aldersgate Street, and in Bartholomew Close, and\r\njust without them in Bunhill Row, and was brought back within them to be\r\nburied in Cripplegate Church. These, and its earlier and many later\r\nliterary associations, help to halo Cheapside and its environs, and, in\r\nspite of the sordid commercial aspect and history that have overtaken it,\r\nto make it for ever a street in the kingdom of romance.\r\n\r\nAnd the chief glory of Cheapside itself is, of course, the Mermaid. One of\r\nthese days a fitting sign will be placed above the spot where it stood,\r\nand set forth in letters of gold the great names that are inseparable from\r\nits story, and first among these will be the names of Shakespeare, Ben\r\nJonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Selden, Donne, Carew, Fuller, Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh.\r\n\r\nThe Mermaid rose on Cheapside with a side entrance in Friday Street, and\r\nof evenings when no business took him to the theatre, or towards midnight\r\nwhen he was on his way home from it, Shakespeare often turned aside into\r\nthis famous meeting-place of the immortals of his generation. Everybody is\r\nfamiliar with those rapturous lines in Beaumont's letter to Ben Jonson,\r\n\"written before he and Master Fletcher came to London with two of the\r\nprecedent comedies, then not finished, which deferred their merry meetings\r\nat the Mermaid;\" but one cannot talk of the Mermaid without remembering\r\nthem and quoting from them once again:--\r\n\r\n                      \"In this warm shine\r\n  I lie and dream of your full Mermaid wine....\r\n  Methinks the little wit I had is lost\r\n  Since I saw you: for wit is like a rest\r\n  Held up at tennis, which men do the best\r\n  With the best gamesters! What things have we seen\r\n  Done at the Mermaid! heard words that have been\r\n  So nimble and so full of subtile flame\r\n  As if that every one from whence they came\r\n  Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,\r\n  And had resolved to live a fool the rest\r\n  Of his dull life; then when there hath been thrown\r\n  Wit able enough to justify the town\r\n  For three days past, wit that might warrant be\r\n  For the whole city to talk foolishly\r\n  Till that were cancelled; and when that was gone,\r\n  We left an air behind us which alone\r\n  Was able to make the next two companies\r\n  Right witty; though but downright fools, mere wise.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE. SMITHFIELD.]\r\n\r\nWell might Keats ask in a much later day (probably whilst he was tenanting\r\nthe Cheapside rooms over Bird-in-Hand Court in which he wrote the sonnet\r\non Chapman's Homer):\r\n\r\n  \"Souls of poets dead and gone,\r\n   What Elysium have ye known,\r\n   Happy field or mossy cavern\r\n   Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?\"\r\n\r\nAnd in our own time, in _Christmas at the Mermaid_, Watts-Dunton has\r\nrecreated that glamorous hostelry and brought together again the fine\r\nspirits who used to frequent it--brought them together in an imaginary\r\nwinter's night shortly after Shakespeare had departed from them and gone\r\nback to Stratford for good. Jonson is of that visionary company, and\r\nRaleigh, Lodge, Dekker, Chapman, Drayton and Heywood, and it is Heywood\r\nwho breaks in, after the tale-telling and reminiscent talk, with--\r\n\r\n    \"More than all the pictures, Ben,\r\n      Winter weaves by wood or stream,\r\n    Christmas loves our London, when\r\n      Rise thy clouds of wassail-steam:\r\n    Clouds like these that, curling, take\r\n    Forms of faces gone, and wake\r\n  Many a lay from lips we loved, and make\r\n        London like a dream.\"\r\n\r\nIt is because of the memories that sleep within it, like music in a lute\r\nuntil a hand that knows touches it, because of all it has been, and\r\nbecause it is never more wonderful than when you can so make it like a\r\ndream, that I give thanks for the fog that comes down upon London at\r\nintervals, in the grey months, and with silent wizardries conjures it out\r\nof sight. Look at this same Cheapside on a clear day, and it is simply a\r\nplain, prosperous, common-place street, but when a fog steals quietly\r\nthrough it and spiritualises it to something of the vagueness and grandeur\r\nand mystery of poetry it is no longer a mere earthly thoroughfare under\r\nthe control of the Corporation; it becomes a dream-street in some\r\nmist-built city of the clouds, and you feel that at any moment the\r\npavements might thin out and shred away and let you through into starry,\r\nillimitable spaces. Where the brown fog warms to a misty, golden glow you\r\nknow there are shop windows. As you advance the street-lamps twinkle in\r\nthe thick air, as if they were kindled magically at your coming and\r\nflickered out again directly you were past. The coiling darkness is loud\r\nwith noises of life, but you walk among them with a sense of aloofness and\r\nsolitude, for you can see nothing but flitting shadows all about you and\r\nknow that you are yourself only a shadow to them.\r\n\r\nFor me, three of the loveliest and most strangely touching sights of\r\nLondon are the stars shining very high in the blue and very quietly when\r\nyou look up at them from the roaring depths of a crowded, naphtha-flaring,\r\npoverty-stricken market street; a sunrise brightening over the Thames\r\nbelow London Bridge, while the barges are still asleep with the gleam of\r\ntheir lamps showing pale in the dawn; and the blurred lights and ghostly\r\nbuildings of a long city road that is clothed in mystery and transfigured\r\nby a brooding, dream-haunted fog. Perhaps this is only because of the dim\r\nfeeling one has that the stars and the sunrise are of the things that the\r\nwasting centuries have not changed; and the fog that blots out to-day\r\nmakes it easier to realise that yesterday and the life of yesterday are\r\nclose about us still, and that we might see them with our waking eyes,\r\neven as we see them in our dreams, if the darkness would but lift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST BULK SHOP. CLARE MARKET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWHERE POPE STAYED AT BATTERSEA\r\n\r\n\r\nComing from Chelsea by way of Battersea Bridge, you go a few yards along\r\nthe Battersea Bridge Road, then turn aside into Church Road, and presently\r\nyou pass a narrow, mean street of small houses, which is Bolingbroke Road,\r\nand serves to remind you that the Bolingbrokes were once lords of the\r\nmanor of Battersea and proprietors of the ferry that crossed the river\r\nhereabouts before the first Battersea Bridge was built. A little further\r\ndown Church Road, past squat and grimy houses on the one hand and gaunt\r\nwalls and yawning gateways of mills, distilleries, and miscellaneous\r\n\"works\" on the other, and you come to a gloomy gateway that has \"To\r\nBolingbroke House\" painted up on one of its side-walls. Through this\r\nopening you see a busy, littered yard; straw and scraps of paper and odds\r\nand ends of waste blow about on its stones; stacks of packing-cases and\r\nwooden boxes rise up against a drab background of brick buildings, and\r\ndeep in the yard, with a space before it in which men are at work and a\r\nwaggon is loading, you find the forlorn left wing--all that survives--of\r\nwhat was once the family seat of Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke,\r\nwhose chief title to remembrance now is that he was the friend of\r\nAlexander Pope.\r\n\r\nWorn and dingy with age, its stone porch stained and crumbling, and some\r\nof its windows broken, the place has a strange, neglected look, though it\r\nis still used for business purposes, and you have glimpses of clerks\r\nwriting at their desks in the rooms from which Pope used to gaze out on\r\nvery different surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, indeed, to associate such a house and such a\r\nneighbourhood as this has now become with so fastidious, finicking, and\r\nmodish a poet as Pope. All the adjacent streets are squalid,\r\npoverty-stricken, noisy; along the main road, almost within hearing, trams\r\nand motor-buses shuttle continually to and fro: except for a quaint,\r\ndirty, weary-looking cottage that still stands dreaming here and there\r\namong its ugly, mid-Victorian neighbours, and for the river that laps\r\nbelow the fence at the end of the yard, there is scarcely anything left of\r\nthe quiet, green, rural Battersea village with which he was familiar; even\r\nthe church whose steeple rises near by above the mills, and in which\r\nBolingbroke was buried, was rebuilt a few years after his death.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this weatherbeaten, time-wasted old house down the yard is\r\nthe same house that, when it stood with Bolingbroke's lawn before it and\r\nhis pleasant gardens sloping to the Thames, was the occasional home of\r\nPope, and numbered Swift, Thomson, and other of the great men of letters\r\nof Queen Anne's reign among its visitors. One of the rooms overlooking the\r\nriver, a room lined with cedar, beautifully inlaid, is still known as \"Mr.\r\nPope's parlour\"; it is said to have been used by Pope as his study, and\r\nthat he wrote his _Essay on Man_ in it.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the more fitting that Pope should have dedicated _An Essay\r\non Man_ to Bolingbroke, whom he addresses in the opening lines with that\r\nexhortation:--\r\n\r\n  \"Awake, my St. John, leave all meaner things\r\n   To low ambition, and the pride of kings!\"\r\n\r\nHe dedicated also one of his Imitations of Horace to--\r\n\r\n  \"St. John, whose love indulged my labours past,\r\n   Matures my present, and shall bound my last.\"\r\n\r\nA man of brilliant gifts, both as writer and statesman, Bolingbroke became\r\ninvolved in the political intriguings of his day, and in 1715 had to flee\r\nto Calais to escape arrest for high treason. Eight years later he was\r\nallowed to return, and his forfeited estates were given back to him. On\r\nthe death of his father he took up his residence at Battersea, and it was\r\nthere that he died of cancer in 1751. \"Pope used to speak of him,\" writes\r\nWarton, \"as a being of a superior order that had condescended to visit\r\nthis lower world;\" and he, in his turn, said of Pope, \"I never in my life\r\nknew a man that had so tender a heart for his particular friends, or more\r\ngeneral friendship for mankind.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POPE'S HOUSE. BATTERSEA.]\r\n\r\nAnd on the whole one feels that this character of Pope was truer than Lady\r\nMary Wortley Montagu's presentation of him as \"the wicked asp of\r\nTwickenham\"; for if he was viciously cruel to Colley Cibber and the poor\r\nGrub Street scribblers whom he satirises in _The Dunciad_, he was kindness\r\nitself to Akenside and other of his younger rivals in reading their\r\nmanuscripts and recommending them to his publishers; and if he retorted\r\nbitterly upon Addison after he had fallen out with him, he kept unbroken\r\nto the last his close friendship with Swift, Gay, Garth, Atterbury,\r\nBolingbroke, and with Arbuthnot, for whose services in helping him through\r\n\"this long disease, my life\" he expressed a touchingly affectionate\r\ngratitude. If he had been the heartless little monster his enemies painted\r\nhim he could not have felt so tireless and beautiful a love for his father\r\nand mother and, despite his own feebleness and shattered health, have\r\ndevoted himself so assiduously to the care of his mother in her declining\r\nyears. \"O friend,\" he writes to Arbuthnot, in the Prologue to the\r\nSatires:--\r\n\r\n  \"O friend, may each domestic bliss be thine!\r\n   Be no unpleasing melancholy mine:\r\n   Me let the tender office long engage\r\n   To rock the cradle of reposing age,\r\n   With lenient arts extend a mother's breath,\r\n   Make languor smile, and smooth the bed of death,\r\n   Explore the thought, explain the asking eye,\r\n   And keep a while one parent from the sky.\"\r\n\r\nAll his life, Pope dwelt in London or on the skirts of it. He was\r\ntwenty-eight when, soon after the death of his father in 1715, he leased\r\nthe famous villa at Twickenham and took his mother to live with him there,\r\nand it was from there when she died, a very old lady of ninety-three, that\r\non the 10th June 1783, he wrote to an artist friend the letter that\r\nenshrines his sorrow:--\r\n\r\n\"As I know you and I naturally desire to see one another, I hoped that\r\nthis day our wishes would have met and brought you hither. And this for\r\nthe very reason which possibly might hinder your coming, that my poor\r\nmother is dead. I thank God her death was easy, as her life was innocent,\r\nand as it cost her not a groan or even a sigh, there is yet upon her\r\ncountenance such an expression of tranquillity, nay, almost of pleasure,\r\nthat, far from horrid, it is even amiable to behold it. It would form the\r\nfinest image of a saint expired that ever painter drew, and it would be\r\nthe greatest obligation art could ever bestow on a friend if you could\r\ncome and sketch it for me. I am sure if there be no prevalent obstacle you\r\nwill leave every common business to do this; and I hope to see you this\r\nevening as late as you will, or to-morrow morning as early, before this\r\nwinter flower is faded. I will defer her interment till to-morrow night. I\r\nknow you love me or I would not have written this--I could not (at this\r\ntime) have written at all. Adieu. May you die as happily.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Twickenham Pope made frequent visits to London, where he stayed in\r\nlodgings, or at the houses of friends; and in the last four or five years\r\nof his life, after Bolingbroke had settled down at Battersea, he put up as\r\noften as not at Bolingbroke House. Of his personal appearance at this date\r\nthere are a good many records. One of his numerous lampooners, unkindly\r\nenough but very graphically, pictures him as--\r\n\r\n  \"Meagre and wan, and steeple crowned,\r\n   His visage long, his shoulders round;\r\n   His crippled corse two spindle pegs\r\n   Support, instead of human legs;\r\n   His shrivelled skin's of dusty grain,\r\n   A cricket's voice, and monkey's brain.\"\r\n\r\nHis old enemy, John Dennis, sneering at his hunched and drooping figure,\r\ndescribed him as \"a young, short, squab gentleman, the very bow of the god\r\nof love.\" He had to be laced up tightly in bodices made of stiff\r\ncanvas, so that he might hold himself erect, and, says Dr. Johnson, \"his\r\nstature was so low, that to bring him to a level with a common table it\r\nwas necessary to raise his seat. But his face was not displeasing, and his\r\neyes were animated and vivid.\" And here is Sir Joshua Reynolds's\r\nword-picture of him: \"He was about four feet six inches high, very\r\nhump-backed and deformed. He wore a black coat, and, according to the\r\nfashion of that time, had on a little sword. He had a large and very fine\r\neye, and a long, handsome nose; his mouth had those peculiar marks which\r\nare always found in the mouths of crooked persons, and the muscles which\r\nrun across the cheek were so strongly marked that they seemed like small\r\ncords.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER POPE]\r\n\r\nThis is the queer, misshapen, pathetic little shape that haunts that\r\nold-world house in the yard at Battersea, and you may gather something of\r\nthe life he lived there, and of the writing with which he busied himself\r\nin the cedar parlour, from these extracts out of two of his letters, both\r\nof which were written to Warburton:--\r\n\r\n    \"_January 12, 1743-4._\r\n\r\n    \"Of the public I can tell you nothing worthy of the reflection of a\r\n    reasonable man; and of myself only an account that would give you\r\n    pain; for my asthma has increased every week since you last heard from\r\n    me to the degree of confining me totally to the fireside; so that I\r\n    have hardly seen any of my friends but two (Lord and Lady\r\n    Bolingbroke), who happen to be divided from the world as much as\r\n    myself, and are constantly retired at Battersea. There I have passed\r\n    much of my time, and often wished you of the company, as the best I\r\n    know to make me not regret the loss of others, and to prepare me for a\r\n    nobler scene than any mortal greatness can open to us. I fear by the\r\n    account you gave me of the time you design to come this way, one of\r\n    them (Lord B.) whom I much wish you had a glimpse of (as a being\r\n    _paullo minus ab angelio_), will be gone again, unless you pass some\r\n    weeks in London before Mr. Allen arrives there in March. My present\r\n    indisposition takes up almost all my hours to render a very few of\r\n    them supportable; yet I go on softly to prepare the great edition of\r\n    my things with your notes, and as fast as I receive any from you, I\r\n    add others in order (determining to finish the Epistle to Dr.\r\n    Arbuthnot and two or three of the best of Horace, particularly that of\r\n    Augustus, first), which will fall into the same volume with the Essay\r\n    on Man. I determined to publish a small number of the Essay, and of\r\n    the other on Criticism, ere now, as a sample of the rest, but Bowyer\r\n    advised delay, though I now see I was not in the wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"February 21, 1743-4._\r\n\r\n    \"I own that the late encroachments on my constitution make me willing\r\n    to see the end of all further care about me or my works. I would rest\r\n    from the one in a full resignation of my being to be disposed of by\r\n    the Father of all mercy, and for the other (though indeed a trifle,\r\n    yet a trifle may be some example) I would commit them to the candour\r\n    of a sensible and reflecting judge, rather than to the malice of every\r\n    short-sighted and malevolent critic or inadvertent and censorious\r\n    reader. And no hand can set them in so good a light, or so well turn\r\n    them best side to the day, as your own. This obliges me to confess I\r\n    have for some months thought myself going, and that not slowly, down\r\n    the hill--the rather as every attempt of the physicians, and still the\r\n    last medicines more forcible in their nature, have utterly failed to\r\n    serve me. I was at last, about seven days ago, taken with so violent a\r\n    fit at Battersea, that my friends, Lord Bolingbroke and Lord\r\n    Marchmont, sent for present help to the surgeon, whose bleeding me, I\r\n    am persuaded, saved my life by the instantaneous effect it had, and\r\n    which has continued so much to amend me that I have passed five days\r\n    without oppression, and recovered, what I have three days wanted, some\r\n    degree of expectoration and some hours together of sleep. I can now go\r\n    to Twickenham, to try if the air will not take some part in reviving\r\n    me, if I can avoid colds, and between that place and Battersea, with\r\n    my Lord Bolingbroke, I will pass what I have of life while he stays,\r\n    which I can tell you, to my great satisfaction, will be this fortnight\r\n    or three weeks yet.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year after writing this Pope came to the end of all further care\r\nabout himself and his works; he died at Twickenham, and lies buried under\r\nthe middle aisle of Twickenham Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHOGARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he took up residence at the Twickenham villa, Pope lived for some\r\ntime with his father in one of the houses of Mawson's Buildings (now\r\nMawson Row), Chiswick. So far it has been impossible to decide which of\r\nthese five red-brick houses is the one that was theirs, for the only\r\nevidence of their tenancy consists of certain letters preserved at the\r\nBritish Museum, which are addressed to \"Alexr. Pope, Esquire, Mawson's\r\nBuildings, in Chiswick,\" and on the backs of these are written portions of\r\nthe original drafts of Pope's translation of the Iliad. James Ralph, the\r\nunfortunate poetaster whom Pope satirised in his _Dunciad_, was also a\r\nnative of Chiswick, and lies buried in the parish churchyard. One other\r\nlink Pope has with Chiswick--he wrote a rather poor epigram on Thomas\r\nWood, who resided there, and who seems to have been connected with the\r\nChurch, for according to the poet--\r\n\r\n  \"Tom Wood of Chiswick, deep divine,\r\n   To painter Kent gave all his coin;\r\n   'Tis the first coin, I'm bold to say,\r\n   That ever churchman gave away.\"\r\n\r\nThis Kent, I take it, was the man of the same name who likewise lived at\r\nChiswick in Pope's day, and was more notable as a landscape gardener than\r\nas a painter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POPE. MAWSON'S ROW CHISWICK.]\r\n\r\nBut, to say nothing of William Morris's more recent association with the\r\ndistrict, the most interesting house in Chiswick is Hogarth's. It is a\r\nred-brick villa of the Queen Anne style, with a quaint, overhanging bay\r\nwindow, and stands in a large, walled garden, not far from the parish\r\nchurch. For many years this was Hogarth's summer residence--his\r\n\"villakin,\" as he called it. His workshop, or studio, that used to be at\r\nthe foot of the garden, has been demolished; otherwise the house remains\r\nvery much as it was when he occupied it.\r\n\r\nHogarth was essentially a town man; he was almost, if not quite, as good a\r\nLondoner as Lamb. He was born in Bartholomew Close, West Smithfield, that\r\nstoried place where Milton had lived before, and Washington Irving went to\r\nlive after, him; and he spent nearly all his life in the neighbourhood of\r\nLeicester Square. He was rarely absent from London at all, and never for\r\nlong; even when he was supposed to be passing his summers at his Chiswick\r\nvilla, he made frequent excursions into town, and would put up for a few\r\ndays at his house in Leicester Square--or Leicester Fields, as it then\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nIn 1712 Hogarth went to serve a six years' apprenticeship to Ellis Gamble,\r\na silver-plate engraver, in Cranbourne Alley (now Cranbourne Street), and,\r\non the death of his father in 1718, he started business for himself as an\r\nengraver in what had been his father's house in Long Lane, West\r\nSmithfield, and later removed to the corner of Cranbourne Alley, leaving\r\nhis mother with his two sisters, who had opened shop as mercers, at the\r\nold Long Lane address. He engraved for them a shop card, duly setting\r\nforth that \"Mary and Ann Hogarth, from the old Frock Shop, the corner of\r\nthe Long Wall, facing the Cloysters, Removed to ye King's Arms joining to\r\nye Little Britain Gate, near Long Walk, Sells ye best and most Fashionable\r\nReady Made Frocks, Sutes of Fustian, Ticken, and Holland, Stript Dimity\r\nand Flanel Waistcoats, blue and canvas Frocks, and bluecoat Boys'\r\nDra{rs.}, Likewise Fustians, Tickens, Hollands, white stript Dimitys,\r\nwhite and stript Flanels in ye piece, by Wholesale or Retale at Reasonable\r\nRates.\"\r\n\r\nHogarth was very self-satisfied and rather illiterate; his spelling and\r\nhis grammar--as in this shop-card--were continually going wrong. But he\r\nwas kindly, good-hearted, high-minded, and had imagination and an original\r\ngenius that could laugh at the nice, mechanical accomplishments of the\r\nschoolmaster. It was Nollekens, the sculptor, who said that he frequently\r\nsaw Hogarth sauntering round Leicester Square, playing the nurse, \"with\r\nhis master's sickly child hanging its head over his shoulder.\" That was in\r\nthe early days, when he was still serving his time to Gamble, and not even\r\ndreaming, I suppose, that he would one day own the big house at the\r\nsouth-east corner of the Square, would enjoy some of his highest triumphs\r\nand sharpest humiliations in it, and die in it at last, leaving behind him\r\nwork that would give him a place among the very first of English painters.\r\n\r\nEven before so fastidious a critic as Whistler had declared that Hogarth\r\nwas \"the greatest English artist who ever lived,\" Hazlitt had said much\r\nthe same thing, and paid a glowing tribute to the vitality and dramatic\r\nlife of his pictures; but perhaps no critic has written a finer, more\r\nincisive criticism on him than Lamb did in his essay on \"The Genius and\r\nCharacter of Hogarth.\" Lamb had been familiar with two of Hogarth's series\r\nof prints--\"The Harlot's Progress,\" and \"The Rake's Progress\"--since his\r\nboyhood; and though he was keenly alive to the humour of them, he denied\r\nthat their chief appeal was to the risible faculties. It was their\r\nprofound seriousness, their stern satire, the wonderful creative force\r\nthat underlay them, that most impressed him. \"I was pleased,\" he says,\r\n\"with the reply of a gentleman who, being asked which book he most\r\nesteemed in his library, answered 'Shakespeare'; being asked which he\r\nesteemed next best, replied 'Hogarth.' His graphic representations are\r\nindeed books; they have the teeming, fruitful, suggestive meaning of\r\nwords. Other pictures we look at; his prints we read.\" He protests against\r\nconfounding \"the painting of subjects in common or vulgar life with the\r\nbeing a vulgar artist. The quantity of thought which Hogarth crowds into\r\nevery picture would alone unvulgarise every subject he might choose. Let\r\nus take the lowest of his subjects, the print called 'Gin Lane.' Here is\r\nplenty of poverty and low stuff to disgust upon a superficial view; and\r\naccordingly a cold spectator feels himself immediately disgusted and\r\nrepelled. I have seen many turn away from it, not being able to bear it.\r\nThe same persons would, perhaps, have looked with great complacency upon\r\nPoussin's celebrated picture of the 'Plague of Athens.' Disease and death\r\nand bewildering terror in Athenian garments are endurable, and come, as\r\nthe delicate critics express it, within the 'limits of pleasurable\r\nsensation.' But the scenes of their own St. Giles's, delineated by their\r\nown countryman, are too shocking to think of.... We are for ever deceiving\r\nourselves with names and theories. We call one man a great historical\r\npainter because he has taken for his subjects kings or great men, or\r\ntransactions over which time has thrown a grandeur. We term another the\r\npainter of common life, and set him down in our minds for an artist of an\r\ninferior class, without reflecting whether the quantity of thought shown\r\nby the latter may not much more than level the distinction which their\r\nmere choice of subjects may seem to place between them; or whether, in\r\nfact, from that very common life a great artist may not extract as deep an\r\ninterest as another man from that which we are pleased to call history.\"\r\nHe found that, though many of the pictures had much in them that is ugly\r\nand repellent, \"there is in most of them that sprinkling of the better\r\nnature which, like holy water, chases away and disperses the contagion of\r\nthe bad. They have this in them besides, that they bring us acquainted\r\nwith the everyday human face.\" And because of this, of their truth to\r\ncontemporary life, and the vigorous realism of the stories they tell, he\r\nranked the work of Hogarth not only high among that of the world's great\r\npainters, but with the best novels of such men as Smollett and Fielding.\r\n\r\nAccording to a note in his fragmentary autobiography, Hogarth conceived an\r\nearly admiration for the paintings of Sir James Thornhill, and, somewhere\r\nabout 1727, he joined the painting school that Sir James established in\r\nthe Piazza, at the corner of James Street, Covent Garden. And Sir James\r\nsoon seems to have taken a particular interest in his pupil, and had him\r\nas a frequent visitor to his house at 75 Dean Street, Soho; and on March\r\n23rd, 1729, he eloped with his teacher's daughter, and they were married\r\nat old Paddington Church. There are paintings and decorations still to be\r\nseen on the walls of the Dean Street house, in some of which Hogarth is\r\nbelieved to have had a hand.\r\n\r\nAfter his marriage, Hogarth lived for a while at Lambeth; but it was not\r\nlong before he was reconciled to his father-in-law. In 1730 he was\r\nengaged with Sir James Thornhill on their famous picture of \"The House of\r\nCommons\"; and a year later, when he was engraving his series of prints\r\n\"The Harlot's Progress,\" he and his wife had apparently taken up quarters\r\nwith Sir James in the Piazza.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JAMES THORNHILL. 75 DEAN STREET.]\r\n\r\n\"The Harlot's Progress,\" and the issue of \"The Rake's Progress\" shortly\r\nafterwards, lifted Hogarth into fame. He began to move in better society,\r\nand was to be met with at the fashionable as well as at the Bohemian clubs\r\nof the day. He and Thornhill founded the Arts Club at the Turk's Head, in\r\nGerrard Street; and, after the latter's death, he took over Thornhill's\r\nart school, and transferred it to Peter's Court, St. Martin's Lane.\r\nOccasionally he visited Richardson, the novelist, in Salisbury Court; and\r\nit was here he first made the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson. He struck up a\r\nfriendship with Garrick, too, and painted several portraits of him, for\r\none of which he received two hundred pounds; and with Fielding, of whom he\r\nhas given us the only portrait we possess.\r\n\r\nBy 1733 Hogarth was prosperous enough to take the house in Leicester\r\nSquare that was pulled down, in 1870, to furnish a site for the Archbishop\r\nTenison School that has replaced it; and in 1749, \"having sacrificed\r\nenough to his fame and fortune,\" he purchased the villa at Chiswick as a\r\nsummer holiday home, and became a familiar figure about the Chiswick lanes\r\nfrom time to time--\"a blue-eyed, intelligent little man, with a scar over\r\nhis right eye, and wearing a fur cap.\" Allan Cunningham furnishes a more\r\nvivid description of his personal appearance in his _Lives of the\r\nPainters_, where he says he was \"rather below the middle height; his eye\r\nwas peculiarly bright and piercing; his look shrewd, sarcastic, and\r\nintelligent; the forehead high and round. He was active in person,\r\nbustling in manner, and fond of affecting a little state and importance.\r\nHe was of a temper cheerful, joyous, and companionable, fond of mirth and\r\ngood-fellowship.\" Benjamin West called him a strutting, consequential\r\nlittle man; and, one way and another, we know that he was sturdy,\r\nobstinate, pugnacious, and that once he thrashed a ruffian whom he found\r\nmaltreating the beautiful drummeress that he sketched in his picture of\r\nSouthwark Fair. Possibly that scar over his right eye was a record of this\r\nchivalrous deed.\r\n\r\nThere are very few records of his home life, and these are of the\r\nhomeliest, most ordinary sort. He was fond of smoking, and the arm-chair,\r\nin which he was wont to sit with his pipe, is still preserved at Chiswick.\r\nHe had a favourite dog, a pet cat, and a bullfinch, which he buried in his\r\nChiswick garden, commemorating them with tablets that have now vanished\r\nfrom the wall, the bird's epitaph being \"Alas, poor Dick!\" and the dog's,\r\n\"Life to the last enjoyed, here Pompey lies\"--which parodies a line in the\r\n_Candidate_, by that dissipated, brilliant satirist, Charles Churchill:\r\n\"Life to the last enjoyed, here Churchill lies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH'S HOUSE. CHISWICK.]\r\n\r\nThe _Candidate_ was published at the beginning of 1764, and on the 25th\r\nOctober of that year Hogarth died. Churchill had been a warm friend of\r\nhis, but before the end had become one of his bitterest enemies--that\r\nenmity arising in this wise. In 1762 Hogarth published a political print\r\ncalled the _Times_, in which he supported the policy of Lord Bute, and\r\nridiculed Pitt, Temple, and Wilkes. By way of retaliation, Wilkes wrote a\r\nscathing attack upon Hogarth in his paper, the _North Briton_, in which he\r\nmade a sneering reference to Mrs. Hogarth. This stirred Hogarth to anger;\r\nand when Wilkes was presently arrested on a charge of high treason, he sat\r\nin court and sketched the prisoner, immortalising his villainous squint,\r\nand accentuating all the worst qualities in his features. On this print\r\nmaking its appearance, Churchill, a staunch friend and partisan of Wilkes,\r\ntook up the cudgels, and scarified Hogarth without mercy in _An Epistle to\r\nWilliam Hogarth_ (1763), praising his art, but pouring contempt upon his\r\nenvy and self-esteem, and affecting to believe that he was in his\r\ndotage. He can laud the genius, he says, but not the man.\r\n\r\n                          \"Freely let him wear\r\n  The wreath which Genius wove and planted there:\r\n  Foe as I am, should envy tear it down,\r\n  Myself would labour to replace the crown....\r\n  Hogarth unrivalled stands, and shall engage\r\n  Unrivalled praise to the most distant age.\"\r\n\r\nBut for the man--\r\n\r\n  \"Hogarth, stand forth--I dare thee to be tried\r\n   In that great Court where Conscience must preside;\r\n   At that most solemn bar hold up thy hand;\r\n   Think before whom, on what account you stand;\r\n   Speak, but consider well;--from first to last\r\n   Review thy life, weigh every action past.\r\n   Canst thou remember from thy earliest youth,\r\n   And as thy God must judge thee, speak the truth,\r\n   A single instance where, self laid aside,\r\n   And Justice taking place of Fear and Pride,\r\n   Thou with an equal eye didst Genius view,\r\n   And give to Merit what was Merit's due?\r\n   Genius and Merit are a sure offence,\r\n   And thy soul sickens at the name of sense.\r\n   Is any one so foolish to succeed?\r\n   On Envy's altar he is doomed to bleed;\r\n   Hogarth, a guilty pleasure in his eyes,\r\n   The place of executioner supplies;\r\n   See how he gloats, enjoys the sacred feast,\r\n   And proves himself by cruelty a priest....\r\n     Oft have I known thee, Hogarth, weak and vain,\r\n   Thyself the idol of thy awkward strain,\r\n   Through the dull measure of a summer's day,\r\n   In phrase most vile, prate long, long hours away,\r\n   Whilst friends with friends all gaping sit, and gaze,\r\n   To hear a Hogarth babble Hogarth's praise....\r\n     With all the symptoms of assured decay,\r\n   With age and sickness pinched and worn away,\r\n   Pale quivering lips, lank cheeks, and faltering tongue,\r\n   The spirits out of tune, the nerves unstrung,\r\n   The body shrivelled up, the dim eyes sunk\r\n   Within their sockets deep, thy weak hams shrunk,\r\n   The body's weight unable to sustain,\r\n   The stream of life scarce trembling through the vein,\r\n   More than half killed by honest truths which fell,\r\n   Through thy own fault, from men who wished thee well--\r\n   Canst thou, e'en thus, thy thoughts to vengeance give\r\n   And, dead to all things else, to malice live?\r\n   Hence, dotard, to thy closet; shut thee in;\r\n   By deep repentance wash away thy sin;\r\n   From haunts of men to shame and sorrow fly,\r\n   And, on the verge of death, learn how to die!\"\r\n\r\nHurt and deeply mortified, a month later Hogarth satirised Churchill's\r\nformer connection with the Church and present loose living in a caricature\r\nwhich represented him as a bear wearing torn clerical bands, with ruffles\r\non his paws, in one hand a pot of porter, and in the other a bundle of\r\nlies and copies of the _North Briton_. Garrick had heard that Churchill\r\nwas making ready to issue that vitriolic satire of his, and hastened to\r\nbeg him, \"by the regard you profess to me, that you don't tilt at my\r\nfriend Hogarth before you see me. He is a great and original genius. I\r\nlove him as a man, and reverence him as an artist. I would not for all the\r\npolitics and politicians in the universe that you two should have the\r\nleast cause of ill-will to each other. I am sure you will not publish\r\nagainst him if you think twice.\" One could honour Garrick if it were for\r\nnothing else but that letter; but it was written in vain, and the\r\nexasperation and humiliation that Hogarth suffered under Churchill's lash\r\nare said to have hastened his death. He had been broken in health and\r\nailing all through the summer of 1764, but took several plates down to\r\nhis Chiswick villa with him for retouching, and--possibly with some\r\nforeboding of his own approaching dissolution--drew for a new volume of\r\nhis prints a tailpiece depicting \"the end of all things.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAY WINDOW. HOGARTH'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nBut he could not be satisfied to keep away from London, and on 25th\r\nOctober was conveyed from Chiswick to his house in Leicester Square, \"very\r\nweak,\" says Nichols, \"but remarkably cheerful, and, receiving an agreeable\r\nletter from Dr. Franklin\" (Benjamin Franklin was, by the way, dwelling at\r\nthis time in Bartholomew Close; he did not remove to 7 Craven Street,\r\nStrand, until three years later), \"he drew up a rough draft of an answer\r\nto it; but, going to bed, was seized with a vomiting, upon which he rang\r\nthe bell with such violence that he broke it, and expired about two hours\r\nafterwards in the arms of Mrs. Mary Lewis, who was called up on his being\r\nsuddenly taken ill.\"\r\n\r\nHe was buried in Chiswick Churchyard; and in 1771 his friends erected a\r\nmonument over him, the epitaph on which was written by Garrick:--\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell, great Painter of Mankind,\r\n     Who reached the noblest point of Art,\r\n   Whose pictured morals charm the Mind,\r\n     And through the eye correct the Heart.\r\n\r\n   If Genius fire thee, Reader, stay;\r\n     If Nature touch thee, drop a tear;\r\n   If neither move thee, turn away,\r\n     For Hogarth's honoured dust lies here.\"\r\n\r\nGarrick sent his verses to Dr. Johnson, who frankly criticised them, and\r\noffered him a revised version, the first lines of which were a distinct\r\nimprovement:--\r\n\r\n  \"The hand of Art here torpid lies\r\n     That traced the essential form of Grace;\r\n   Here Death has closed the curious eyes\r\n     That saw the manners in the face.\"...\r\n\r\nGarrick preferred his own composition, slightly altered, as it now\r\nappears; but Johnson's was certainly the better effort of the two.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hogarth retained possession of the Leicester Square house until her\r\ndeath in 1789, but she resided principally at Chiswick. Sir Richard\r\nPhillips saw her there, when he was a boy, and had vivid recollections of\r\nher as a stately old lady, wheeled to the parish church on Sundays in a\r\nbath-chair, and sailing in up the nave with her raised head-dress, silk\r\nsacque, black calash, and crutched cane, accompanied by a relative (the\r\nMary Lewis who was with Hogarth when he died), and preceded by her\r\ngrey-haired man-servant, Samuel, who carried her prayer-books, and, after\r\nshe was seated, shut the pew door on her.\r\n\r\nFrom 1824 to 1826 the Hogarth villa was inhabited by the Rev. H. F. Cary,\r\nthe translator of Dante, who was one of Charles Lamb's many friends, and\r\nwrote the feeble epitaph that is on his tomb at Edmonton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGOLDSMITH, REYNOLDS, AND SOME OF THEIR CIRCLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of Sir James Thornhill's illustrious sitters was Sir Isaac Newton, who\r\nlived within a stone's throw of Hogarth's London house, just round the\r\ncorner out of Leicester Square, at No. 35 St. Martin's Street. Here Sir\r\nIsaac made his home from 1720 to 1725. The red brick walls have been\r\nstuccoed over; and the observatory that the philosopher built for himself\r\non the roof, after being turned into a Sunday-school, was removed about\r\nforty years ago, and helped to supply pews for the Orange Street Chapel\r\nthat stands next door.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of Newton's work was done before he set up in St. Martin's\r\nStreet, but he told a friend that the happiest years of his life had been\r\nspent in the observatory there. Though he kept his carriage, lived in some\r\nstyle, had half-a-dozen male and female servants, and was always\r\nhospitable, he was not fond of society, and talked but little in it.\r\nJohnson once remarked to Sir William Jones that if Newton had flourished\r\nin ancient Greece, he would have been worshipped as a divinity, but there\r\nwas nothing godlike in his appearance. \"He was a man of no very promising\r\naspect,\" says Herne; and Humphrey Newton describes his famous relative as\r\nof a carriage \"meek, sedate, and humble; never seeming angry, of\r\nprofound thought, his countenance mild, pleasant, and comely. He always\r\nkept close to his studies.... I never knew him to take any recreation or\r\npastime, thinking all hours lost that were not spent in his studies.\"\r\nThere are a good many stories told of his eccentricities and\r\nabsent-mindedness. He would ride through London in his coach with one arm\r\nout of the window on one side and one out on the other; he would sometimes\r\nstart to get up of a morning and sit down on his bed, absorbed in thought,\r\nand so remain for hours without dressing himself; and, when his dinner was\r\nlaid, he would walk about the room, forgetting to eat it, and carelessly\r\neat it standing when his attention was called to it. On one occasion, when\r\nhe was leading his horse up a hill, he found, when he went to remount on\r\nreaching the top, that the animal had slipped its bridle and stayed behind\r\nwithout his perceiving it, and he had nothing in his hand but some of the\r\nharness. \"When he had friends to entertain,\" according to Dr. Stukeley,\r\n\"if he went into his study to fetch a bottle of wine, there was danger of\r\nhis forgetting them,\" and not coming back again. And it is told of this\r\nsame Dr. Stukeley that he called one day to see Newton, and was shown into\r\nthe dining-room, where Sir Isaac's dinner was in readiness. After a long\r\nwait, feeling hungry as well as impatient, Stukeley ate the cold chicken\r\nintended for his host, and left nothing but the bones. By-and-by Sir Isaac\r\nentered, made his greetings and apologies, and, whilst they were talking,\r\ndrew a chair to the table, took off the dish-cover, and at sight of the\r\nbones merely observed placidly, \"How absent we philosophers are! I had\r\nforgotten that I had dined!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S HOUSE. ST. MARTIN'S STREET. W.C.]\r\n\r\nLater, this same house in St. Martin's Street was occupied by Dr. Burney\r\nand his daughter Fanny, who wrote _Evelina_ here.\r\n\r\nNear by, in Leicester Square again, on the opposite side, and almost\r\nexactly facing Hogarth's residence, was the house of Sir Joshua Reynolds.\r\nFrom 1753 to 1761 Sir Joshua lived at 5 Great Newport Street, which was\r\nbuilt in Charles II.'s days, and is still standing. It is now and has for\r\na century past been occupied by a firm of art dealers; so that it happens\r\nfrom time to time that a picture of Reynolds's is here put up for sale,\r\n\"on the very spot where it was painted.\" But in the crowning years of his\r\ncareer--from 1761 till his death, in 1792--Sir Joshua dwelt at 42\r\nLeicester Square, and what was formerly his studio there has been\r\ntransformed into one of Messrs. Puttick and Simpson's auction rooms. Here\r\nis Allan Cunningham's description of it, and of the painter's method of\r\nwork: \"His study was octagonal, some twenty feet long by sixteen broad,\r\nand about fifteen feet high. The window was small and square, and the sill\r\nnine feet from the floor. His sitters' chair moved on castors, and stood\r\nabove the floor about a foot and a half. He held his palette by the\r\nhandle, and the sticks of his brushes were eighteen inches long. He\r\nwrought standing, and with great celerity. He rose early, breakfasted at\r\nnine, entered his study at ten, examined designs or touched unfinished\r\nportraits, till eleven brought him a sitter; painted till four, then\r\ndressed, and gave the evenings to company.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS' HOUSE. GREAT NEWPORT STREET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STAIRCASE. 41 LEICESTER SQUARE.]\r\n\r\nAnd to the best of good company too. By day, the chariot of a duke or a\r\nmarchioness might drive to his door, and return later to wait for his\r\nlordship or her ladyship, who was occupying the sitter's chair, while Sir\r\nJoshua was busy at his easel; but of an evening he would have such men as\r\nDr. Johnson, Boswell, Goldsmith, Garrick, Burke (who was living close at\r\nhand, in Gerrard Street) gathered about his dinner-table; for in spite of\r\nhis deafness he was the very soul of sociability. He never got out of his\r\nnaturally careless, Bohemian habits. He was the favourite portrait-painter\r\nof the fashionable world, but mixed with the aristocracy without apeing\r\nany of their etiquette. \"There was something singular in the style and\r\neconomy of Sir Joshua's table that contributed to pleasantry and\r\ngood-humour; a coarse, inelegant plenty, without any regard to order and\r\narrangement,\" according to Courtenay. \"A table prepared for seven or\r\neight was often compelled to contain fifteen or sixteen. When this\r\npressing difficulty was got over, a deficiency of knives, plates, forks,\r\nand glasses succeeded. The attendance was in the same style; and it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to call instantly for beer, bread, or wine, that you\r\nmight be supplied with them before the first course was over. He was once\r\nprevailed on to furnish the table with decanters and glasses at dinner, to\r\nsave time and prevent the tardy manoeuvres of two or three occasional,\r\nundisciplined domestics. As these accelerating utensils were demolished in\r\nthe course of service, Sir Joshua would never be persuaded to replace\r\nthem. But these trifling embarrassments only served to enhance the\r\nhilarity and singular pleasure of the entertainment. The wines, cookery,\r\nand dishes were but little attended to; nor was the fish or venison ever\r\ntalked of or recommended. Amidst this convivial, animated bustle among his\r\nguests, our host sat perfectly composed; always attentive to what was\r\nsaid, never minding what was ate or drunk, but left every one at perfect\r\nliberty to scramble for himself. Temporal and spiritual peers, physicians,\r\nlawyers, actors, and musicians composed the motley group, and played their\r\nparts without dissonance or discord.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR BENJAMIN WEST'S HOUSE. NEWMAN STREET.]\r\n\r\nHe was so imperturbable and easy-natured that Dr. Johnson said if he ever\r\nquarrelled with him he would find it most difficult to know how to abuse\r\nhim; and even the sharp-tongued Mrs. Thrale praised his peaceful temper,\r\nand considered that of him \"all good should be said, and no harm.\" He\r\nshared Hogarth's contempt for the old masters; but, unlike Hogarth, he\r\nwas not loud and aggressive in his objections to them.\r\n\r\n  \"When they talked of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff,\r\n   He shifted his trumpet, and only took snuff.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on Reynolds's suggestion that he and Johnson founded, in 1763, what\r\nlater became celebrated as the Literary Club. They held their first\r\nmeetings at the Turk's Head (where Hogarth and Thornhill had previously\r\nestablished their Art Club), and among the original members were Burke,\r\nLangton, Beauclerk, Goldsmith, and Sir John Hawkins. The latter, an arrant\r\nsnob, objected to Goldsmith's election on the ground that he was \"a mere\r\nliterary drudge,\" but his protest carried no weight with the rest. Five\r\nyears later, when, under the patronage of the king, Reynolds inaugurated\r\nthe Royal Academy, Johnson was appointed its first Professor of Ancient\r\nLiterature, and Goldsmith its first Professor of History, Reynolds himself\r\nbeing its first President--in which office, on his death in 1792, he was\r\nsucceeded by Benjamin West. West was an American, and had won a\r\nconsiderable reputation in his own country before he came over and settled\r\ndown in England. He was introduced to Johnson and Reynolds, and was for\r\nsome time a neighbour of Sir Joshua's, in Castle Street, Leicester Square.\r\nBut he is more closely associated with the house that still stands at 14\r\nNewman Street, Oxford Street, in which he lived and worked for forty-five\r\nyears, and in which he died.\r\n\r\nA far greater contemporary painter, who moved on the fringes of Sir\r\nJoshua's circle, was Gainsborough. That he did not come familiarly into\r\nthe circle, and sometimes make one of the memorable company that gathered\r\nround Reynolds's dinner-table, was owing to some lack of geniality in\r\nhimself, that kept him from responding to Sir Joshua's friendly advances.\r\nHe came from Bath to London in 1774, when he was forty-seven years of age,\r\ntook a studio at Schonberg House, Pall Mall, and it was not long before\r\ncelebrities and leaders of fashion were flocking to it to sit for their\r\nportraits, and he was recognised as a successful rival of Reynolds.\r\nReynolds was so far from feeling jealousy or resentment that he promptly\r\npaid his popular rival a visit; but Gainsborough did not trouble himself\r\nto return the call. No doubt it was to some extent owing to Reynolds, too,\r\nthat in the year of his appearance in London he was elected to the council\r\nof management of the Royal Academy; but he ignored the honour, did not\r\nattend any meetings, and sent nothing to the exhibition. Reynolds was\r\nfrankly outspoken in his admiration of Gainsborough's work, and was even\r\nanxious to have his own portrait painted by him. After some delay\r\nappointments were fixed, and Sir Joshua duly went to Schonberg House, and\r\nthe painting was commenced. But after the first sitting he was taken ill;\r\nand when, on his recovery, he wrote to tell Gainsborough that he was ready\r\nto come again, he received no reply, and the portrait had to remain an\r\nunfinished sketch.\r\n\r\nHis coldness to Reynolds is inexplicable, for he was a kindly-disposed\r\nman, and sociable. He kept almost open house in Pall Mall, and such jovial\r\nspirits as the Sheridans, Colman, and Garrick were among the constant\r\nguests at his table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAINSBOROUGH'S HOUSE. PALL MALL.]\r\n\r\nThe year after Gainsborough's coming to London, Sheridan's _Rivals_ was\r\nproduced at the Covent Garden Theatre, to be followed two years after by\r\n_The School for Scandal_. Before he was out of his twenties Sheridan had\r\nfinished his career as a dramatist, turned to politics, and was one of the\r\nmost brilliant of Parliamentary orators, still remaining principal\r\nproprietor of Drury Lane Theatre. All his life he was living beyond his\r\nincome, borrowing, getting into debt, and dodging duns and bailiffs with\r\nthe gayest imperturbability. Everybody liked him, and was susceptible to\r\nhis charm. Wherever the wits foregathered, he was the best drinker, the\r\nbest talker, and the wittiest among them. Byron writes of him in his\r\n_Diary_: \"What a wreck that man is! and all from bad pilotage; for no one\r\nhad ever better gales, though now and then a little too squally. Poor dear\r\nSherry! I shall never forget the day he and Rogers and Moore and I passed\r\ntogether; when he talked and we listened, without one yawn, from six till\r\none in the morning.\" In a letter to Moore, Byron records a dinner at which\r\nSheridan, Colman, and a large party were present, and at the finish, when\r\nthey were all the worse for drink, \"Kinnaird and I had to conduct Sheridan\r\ndown a damned corkscrew staircase, which had certainly been constructed\r\nbefore the discovery of fermented liquors, and to which no legs, however\r\ncrooked, could possibly accommodate themselves. We deposited him safe at\r\nhome, where his man, evidently used to the business, waited to receive him\r\nin the hall.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in October 1815, and 14 Savile Row is the house at which Sheridan\r\nwas thus deposited by his noble friend. He was then an old man of\r\nsixty-four, and a year later he died there, five thousand pounds in debt,\r\nand only saved, by the emphatic intervention of the doctor who was\r\nattending him, from being arrested by bailiffs as he lay dying, and\r\ncarried off to a sponging-house in his blankets.\r\n\r\nThe year that brought Gainsborough to London (1774) was also the year of\r\nGoldsmith's death; and I want to get back to Goldsmith for a little, in\r\nthis chapter, and to say something of Richardson. For it is curiously\r\ninteresting to note how the lives of all these famous men, though there\r\nwas little enough in common between some of them, met at certain points\r\nand established certain connecting links between them; so that it is\r\npossible, as Leigh Hunt has said somewhere, to trace a sort of genealogy\r\nof such acquaintanceships, such notable meetings and touchings of \"beamy\r\nhands,\" coming down in an unbroken line from Shakespeare to our own day.\r\n\r\nThus, Hogarth first met Johnson in Richardson's parlour at Salisbury\r\nCourt; and, in 1757, Goldsmith was employed by Richardson, and worked on\r\nhis printing premises, in the same court, as reader and corrector to the\r\npress; and these, and most of the other immortals named in this\r\nchapter--including Sheridan, though he was then so young a man that he\r\noutlived them all, and counts among the friends of Lord Byron--have a\r\ncommon link in Dr. Johnson, who was so great a Londoner that he must needs\r\nhave a chapter presently to himself, or one that he shall share with none\r\nbut the inevitable Boswell.\r\n\r\nWhilst Goldsmith was working as one of his employees, Richardson was\r\nnot only a prosperous printer, he was already the most popular novelist of\r\nhis day. _Pamela_, _Clarissa Harlowe_, and _Sir Charles Grandison_ had\r\ncarried his fame throughout the kingdom and beyond it, and were drawing\r\nrapturous admiration and tears of sentiment from countless admirers in\r\nFrance as well as in England; and, as befitted a man of his means and\r\neminence, he had supplemented his house off Fleet Street with a country\r\nresidence at Parson's Green, where he died in 1761. Down to 1754, however,\r\nhis country house was The Grange, at North End, Fulham, then a pretty,\r\nold-world spot,--\"the pleasantest village within ten miles of London.\" And\r\nit was here that all his novels were written; for he took The Grange in\r\n1738, and _Pamela_ appeared in 1740, and _Sir Charles Grandison_ in 1753.\r\nHere, too, he used to give large literary parties, to which Johnson\r\noccasionally went with Boswell. But whatever other authors were there, you\r\nmay safely depend that Fielding was never among the guests; for with all\r\nhis high morality Richardson was intolerably self-complacent and vain, and\r\nnever forgave Fielding for burlesquing Pamela as \"Shamela,\" and parodying\r\nher impossible virtues in _Joseph Andrews_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHERIDAN'S HOUSE. SAVILE ROW.]\r\n\r\nBoswell gives two good anecdotes illustrative of Richardson's fretful\r\nvanity and the limits of his conversational powers. \"Richardson had little\r\nconversation,\" he says Johnson once remarked to him, \"except about his own\r\nworks, of which Sir Joshua Reynolds said he was always willing to talk,\r\nand glad to have them introduced. Johnson, when he carried Mr. Langton to\r\nsee him, professed that he could bring him out in conversation, and used\r\nthis illusive expression: 'Sir, I can make him _rear_.' But he failed; for\r\nin that interview Richardson said little else than that there lay in the\r\nroom a translation of his _Clarissa_ into German.\" And in a footnote to\r\nthis Boswell adds: \"A literary lady has favoured me with a characteristic\r\nanecdote of Richardson. One day at his country house at North End, where a\r\nlarge company was assembled at dinner, a gentleman who was just returned\r\nfrom Paris, willing to please Mr. Richardson, mentioned to him a very\r\nflattering circumstance--that he had seen his _Clarissa_ lying on the\r\nking's brother's table. Richardson, observing that part of the company\r\nwere engaged in talking to each other, affected not to attend to it. But\r\nby-and-by, when there was a general silence, and he thought that the\r\nflattery might be fully heard, he addressed himself to the gentleman, 'I\r\nthink, sir, you were saying something about--' pausing in a high flutter\r\nof expectation. The gentleman, provoked at his inordinate vanity, resolved\r\nnot to indulge it, and with an exquisitely sly air of indifference\r\nremarked, 'A mere trifle, sir, not worth repeating.' The mortification of\r\nRichardson was visible, and he did not speak ten words more the whole day.\r\nDr. Johnson was present, and appeared to enjoy it much.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUMP COURT. TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nWhile Fielding was roystering in the wild haunts of Bohemian London,\r\ngambling at his club, reeling home to his chambers in Pump Court, and\r\nwriting his novels in odds and ends of soberer time, Richardson was\r\nmethodically composing his books at Fulham, getting up early of summer\r\nmornings, working at his manuscript in the little summer-house that he\r\nhad built in his garden, then reading over breakfast to the worshipping\r\nmembers of his family the results of his morning's labour. Wherever he\r\nwent, groups of adoring ladies were sure to gather about him, to chatter\r\nfervently of their delight in his interminable stories; and he snuffed up\r\ntheir incense with a solemn and self-satisfied joy, for he took himself as\r\nseriously as he was taken by them, and never felt that he was ridiculous,\r\neven when he looked it. Not infrequently he would sit in his drawing-room\r\nat The Grange, or in the summer-house, surrounded by a rapt audience of\r\nfeminine believers, who wept as he read aloud to them of the sufferings\r\nand heroic virtue of Pamela, or the persecutions of the gentle Clarissa.\r\nYou cannot think of it without imagining there, in one of the rooms, the\r\ncomfortable, obese, touchy, rather pompous, double-chinned little\r\ngentleman, in his fair wig and dark coat, an ink-horn set in the arm of\r\nhis chair with a quill sticking out of it, one hand thrust into the front\r\nof his waistcoat, the book or manuscript in his hand, reading gravely and\r\ndeliberately his long, minute dissections of character, his elaborate\r\ndescriptions of events and incidents, his formal dialogues, pleased when\r\nhis stilted sentiment or simple sentimentality brought tears to the eyes\r\nof his listeners, and not ashamed to shed one or two with them.\r\n\r\nHe drew a word-portrait of himself for Lady Bradshaigh, which is fairly\r\nwell known but is worth repeating, and, judging by the portraits we have\r\nof him, is a fairly true one. He paints himself as \"short, rather plump,\r\nabout five feet five inches, fair wig, one hand generally in his bosom,\r\nthe other a cane in it, which he leans upon under the skirts of his coat\r\nthat it may imperceptibly serve him as a support when attacked by sudden\r\ntremors or dizziness, which too frequently attack him, but, thank God! not\r\nso often as formerly; looking directly forthright, as passers-by would\r\nimagine, but observing all that stirs on either hand of him without moving\r\nhis short neck; hardly ever turning back; of a light-brown complexion,\r\nteeth not yet failing him; smooth faced, and ruddy cheeked; at some times\r\nlooking to be about sixty-five, at other times much younger; a regular,\r\neven pace, stealing away the ground rather than seeming to rid it; a grey\r\neye, too often overclouded by mistiness from the head; by chance\r\nlively--very lively it will be, if he have hope of seeing a lady whom he\r\nloves and honours.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARDSON'S HOUSE. NORTH END FULHAM.]\r\n\r\nRichardson's summer-house is long since gone from the garden, and long ago\r\nnow The Grange was divided in two, and in the half that has been\r\nstucco-fronted Burne-Jones went to live in 1867, dying there in 1898.\r\n\r\nFive years after Goldsmith had given up proofreading for Richardson, you\r\nfind him still drudging amid the squalor of Grub Street, still living from\r\nhand to mouth, writing reviews and prefaces, revising and preparing new\r\neditions of dull books on dull subjects, for a sum of twenty-one pounds\r\ncompiling a two-volume _History of England_ in the form of a series of\r\nletters, and generally subduing his heart and mind to the doing of the\r\nwretched hack-work to which the impecunious literary man in all ages has\r\nusually been condemned.\r\n\r\nHis new taskmaster was Mr. Newbery the publisher, and he was living, in\r\nthose days of 1762, in Wine Office Court, Fleet Street; but the publisher\r\nwas not altogether ungenerous, and made arrangements that enabled his poor\r\nhack to leave town at intervals and work in the fresh air and rural\r\nenvironment of Islington. Newbery had chambers of his own there in\r\nCanonbury Tower, and Goldsmith used to put up at a cottage near by that\r\nwas kept by an elderly Mrs. Fleming, a friend or relative of Newbery's,\r\nhis bills for board and lodging being periodically settled by his\r\nemployer, who deducted the amount of them from whatever fell due to\r\nGoldsmith from time to time for work done. Fortunately Mrs. Fleming's\r\naccounts have been preserved, and we get an idea of Goldsmith's wardrobe\r\nfrom her washing-lists, and learn from the items she carefully details\r\nthat she now and then lent him small sums in cash--tenpence one day, and\r\none and twopence another; that occasionally, when he had a friend to\r\ndinner, though she duly noted it, she ostentatiously made no charge;\r\nbut when four gentlemen came to take tea with him, she debited him with\r\neighteenpence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDSMITH'S HOUSE. CANONBURY.]\r\n\r\nProbably one of those friends who had a free dinner was Hogarth, for he\r\ntravelled out to Islington occasionally on a visit to Goldsmith; and there\r\nis a painting of his which is known as \"Goldsmith's Hostess,\" and is\r\nbelieved to be none other than Mrs. Fleming's portrait.\r\n\r\nYou remember Boswell's story of how _The Vicar of Wakefield_ saved\r\nGoldsmith from imprisonment for debt. \"I received one morning a letter\r\nfrom poor Goldsmith that he was in great distress,\" Johnson told him,\r\n\"and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come\r\nto him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to\r\nhim directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that\r\nhis landlady had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in a violent\r\npassion. I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had got a\r\nbottle of madeira and a glass before him. I put the cork in the bottle,\r\ndesired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which\r\nhe might be extricated. He then told me that he had a novel ready for the\r\npress, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its merit. I\r\ntold the landlady I should soon return; and, having gone to a bookseller,\r\nsold it for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged\r\nhis rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used\r\nhim so ill.\" Everything points to Mrs. Fleming as that harsh landlady, and\r\nthe lodging in her cottage at Islington as the scene of that famous\r\ninterlude. The presumption is that Goldsmith had incurred a much heavier\r\nliability to her than was covered by what was accruing to him for his\r\nservices to Newbery, as a result of his giving time to the writing of _The\r\nVicar of Wakefield_ that should have been devoted to his usual drudgery;\r\nand the cautious Newbery declined to make further advances, and advised\r\nhis relative, the landlady, to adopt summary methods for the recovery of\r\nher debt. Goldsmith never lodged with Mrs. Fleming after that date; but\r\nlater, when Newbery took a lease of Canonbury Tower, he was from time to\r\ntime a guest there, and occupied a room in the turret. During one of these\r\nvisits he wrote _The Traveller_; and in later years Charles Lamb often\r\nwalked across from his Islington home to the Tower to watch the sunset\r\nfrom the summit, and to be entertained by the tenant of it in the panelled\r\nchamber where Goldsmith's poem was written.\r\n\r\nIt was with the publication of _The Traveller_ that Goldsmith began to\r\nemerge from Grub Street. Its success was considerable enough to lead to\r\nthe publisher's looking out the manuscript of _The Vicar of Wakefield_,\r\nand issuing that also; and in 1768, having made five hundred pounds by the\r\nproduction and publishing of _The Good-natured Man_, he removed from an\r\nattic in the Staircase, Inner Temple, and purchased a lease of three rooms\r\non the second floor of 2 Brick Court, Temple. Blackstone, the lawyer, then\r\nworking on his _Commentaries_, had chambers immediately below him, and\r\ncomplained angrily of the distracting noises--the singing, dancing, and\r\nplaying blind-man's-buff--that went on over his head when Goldsmith was\r\nentertaining his friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVER GOLDSMITH]\r\n\r\nPale, round-faced, plain-featured, with a bulging forehead and an ugly,\r\nlong upper lip, there was more of kindness and geniality than of dignity\r\nor intellect in Goldsmith's appearance. \"His person was short,\" says\r\nBoswell, who was jealous of his friendship with Johnson, and never\r\nrealised how great he was, \"his countenance was coarse and vulgar, his\r\ndeportment that of a scholar awkwardly affecting the easy gentleman. Those\r\nwho were in any way distinguished excited envy in him to so ridiculous an\r\nexcess that the instances of it are hardly credible.\" But Boswell\r\nmisjudged him because, conceited and petty himself, he easily read those\r\nqualities into the behaviour of the other, and so misunderstood him.\r\nGoldsmith may have had some harmless vanity in the matter of dress, when\r\nhe could afford to indulge it; but as for vanity of his achievements, that\r\nspeaking of poetry as\r\n\r\n  \"My shame in crowds, my solitary pride,\"\r\n\r\nis the spontaneous confession of a naturally shy and diffident spirit.\r\nWhen a man has been buffeted as he had been, has had to slave so hard and\r\nwait so long for his reward as he had slaved and waited, he accepts the\r\nfame that comes to him merely as wages well earned, and is not likely to\r\ngrow swollen-headed concerning it. And for his envious character--here is\r\nwhat Boswell gives as a specimen of it. Johnson had come from an\r\nunexpected interview with the king, and a party of friends at Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds's house in Leicester Square were gathered about him pressing for\r\na full account of what had taken place. During all the time that Johnson\r\nwas employed in this narration, remarks Boswell, \"Dr. Goldsmith remained\r\nunmoved upon a sofa at some distance, affecting not to join in the least\r\nin the eager curiosity of the company. He assigned as a reason for his\r\ngloom and seeming inattention that he apprehended Johnson had relinquished\r\nhis purpose of furnishing him with a prologue to his play, with the hopes\r\nof which he had been flattered; but it was strongly suspected that he was\r\nfretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honour Dr. Johnson had\r\nlately enjoyed. At length, the frankness and simplicity of his natural\r\ncharacter prevailed. He sprung from the sofa, advanced to Johnson, and in\r\na kind of flutter from imagining himself in the situation which he had\r\njust been hearing described, exclaimed, 'Well, you acquitted yourself in\r\nthis conversation better than I should have done; for I should have bowed\r\nand stammered through the whole of it.'\" Naturally this talk with the king\r\nwould not seem such a breathlessly overwhelming honour to such a man as\r\nGoldsmith as to such a snob as Boswell. It was in keeping with Goldsmith's\r\nnature that he should sit quietly listening and imagining the whole thing\r\nas he heard about it, instead of fussing round open-mouthed to pester the\r\nnarrator with trivial questions; but Boswell was incapable of realising\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2 BRICK COURT. THE TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nWhen Boswell, in his toadying spirit, was saying that in any conversation\r\nJohnson was entitled to the honour of unquestionable superiority, and\r\nGoldsmith, with a truer conception of the art and pleasure of social\r\nintercourse, replied, \"Sir, you are for making a monarchy of what should\r\nbe a republic,\" Boswell took it as another proof of Goldsmith's envy, and\r\nof his \"incessant desire of being conspicuous in company.\" He goes on\r\nto say: \"He was still more mortified when, talking in a company with\r\nfluent vivacity and, as he flattered himself, to the admiration of all who\r\nwere present, a German who sat next to him, and perceived Johnson rolling\r\nhimself as if about to speak, suddenly stopped him, saying, 'Stay, stay!\r\nToctor Shonson is going to say something!' This was no doubt very\r\nprovoking, especially to one so irritable as Goldsmith, who frequently\r\nmentioned it with strong expressions of indignation.\" A vain man would\r\nnot have mentioned it frequently, but a man with Goldsmith's sense of fun\r\nwould be tickled by it, and rejoice to tell it as a joke against himself,\r\nsimulating indignation to heighten the jest. When he heard that jape at\r\nSir Joshua's table of taking peas to Hammersmith because that was the way\r\nto Turn'am Green, and afterwards retelling it muddled the phrase and made\r\nnonsense of it, Boswell offers it as further evidence that he was a\r\nblundering fool. But it is more likely that he blundered on purpose,\r\nmerely to raise a laugh, that being his queer, freakish fashion of humour.\r\nBut the Laird of Auchinleck and some of the others were too staid and\r\nheavy to follow his nimble wits in their grotesque and airy dancings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAIRS UP TO SECOND FLOOR. 2 BRICK COURT.]\r\n\r\nWhy, even the egregious Boswell has to admit that \"Goldsmith, however, was\r\noften very fortunate in his witty contests, even when he entered the lists\r\nwith Johnson himself.\" And once, when Johnson observed, \"It is amazing how\r\nlittle Goldsmith knows; he seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than\r\nany one else,\" Reynolds put in quietly, \"Yet there is no man whose company\r\nis more liked\"; and the Doctor promptly admitted that, saying, \"When\r\npeople find a man of the most distinguished abilities as a writer their\r\ninferior while he is with them, it must be highly gratifying to them.\" But\r\nthat did not fully explain why he was liked, of course; and what Johnson\r\nadded as to \"what Goldsmith comically says of himself\" shows that Goldie\r\nknew his own weaknesses, and was amused by them. Lamb would have\r\nunderstood him and laughed with him, for he loved to frivol and play the\r\nfool in the same vein. When he was dead, Johnson said he was \"a very\r\ngreat man\"; and don't you think there is some touch of remorse in that\r\nlater remark of his, that the partiality of Goldsmith's friends was always\r\nagainst him, and \"it was with difficulty we could give him a hearing\"?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDSMITH'S GRAVE.]\r\n\r\nWhen he lay dead in his chambers at 2 Brick Court, as Forster relates, the\r\nstaircase was filled with mourners the reverse of domestic--\"women without\r\na home, without domesticity of any kind, with no friend but him they had\r\ncome to weep for; outcasts of that great, solitary, wicked city, to whom\r\nhe had never forgotten to be kind and charitable. And he had domestic\r\nmourners, too. His coffin was reopened at the request of Miss Horneck and\r\nher sister (such was the regard he was known to have for them), that a\r\nlock might be cut from his hair. It was in Mrs. Gwyn's possession when she\r\ndied, after nearly seventy years.\" When Burke was told that Goldsmith was\r\ndead, he burst into tears; and when the news reached Reynolds in his\r\nLeicester Square painting-room, he laid his brush aside--a thing he had\r\nnot been known to do even in times of great family distress--left his\r\nstudy, and entered it no more that day. A vain and envious fool is not\r\nmourned in that fashion.\r\n\r\n\"I have been many a time in the chambers in the Temple which were his,\"\r\nwrites Thackeray, \"and passed up the staircase which Johnson and Burke and\r\nReynolds trod to see their friend, their poet, their kind Goldsmith--the\r\nstair on which the poor women sat weeping bitterly when they heard that\r\nthe greatest and most generous of all men was dead within the black oak\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\nNo. 2 Brick Court would be memorable enough if it held no other memory;\r\nbut in 1839 Mackworth Praed died in the same house, and for a short time\r\nin 1855 Thackeray too had chambers in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHOMES AND HAUNTS OF JOHNSON AND BOSWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we were not quite such a business people, and had not so fully\r\nsatisfied ourselves that the making of money is the chief end of\r\nexistence, we should put up a statue to Dr. Johnson in Fleet Street, even\r\nif we had to knock down a house or two to find room for it. The statue by\r\nMr. Percy Fitzgerald that has been erected in St. Clement Danes\r\nChurchyard, in the Strand, is better than nothing, but it is too\r\ninsignificant in appearance, and stands in the wrong place. Johnson is\r\nstill so far removed from death that he is more alive to-day than when he\r\nwas living, and Fleet Street, and the courts and alleys opening out of\r\nFleet Street, are his proper kingdom. Other great spirits haunt the same\r\nground, but he overshadows them all.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another during the later forty-seven years of his life\r\nJohnson had sixteen different addresses in London, and six of them were in\r\nFleet Street byways. On his first visit to town, in 1737, he had lodgings\r\nat Exeter Street, Strand, and made some short stay at Greenwich, whence he\r\nwrote to Cave, the publisher, offering to contribute to his _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_. Next year he and his wife finally removed from Lichfield, and\r\nlodged first in Woodstock Street, Hanover Square, and then in Castle\r\nStreet, Cavendish Square. Presently he flitted to the Strand; to Bow\r\nStreet; to Holborn; to Fetter Lane; to Holborn again; then to Gough\r\nSquare, at the top of Wine Office Court, where he lived for ten years;\r\nthen to Staple Inn; to Gray's Inn; to No. 1 Inner Temple Lane; to No. 7\r\nJohnson's Court (so named before his time, as Boswell Court was before\r\nBoswell's); and thence to Bolt Court, where, in 1784, he died.\r\n\r\nOf all these homes of Johnson's, only two are now surviving--that in\r\nStaple Inn, which cannot be identified (we know only that it was one of\r\nthe houses in the square); and that in Gough Square, which, next to the\r\nBolt Court house, was the most interesting of his sixteen residences--and\r\none is grateful that, mainly owing to the good offices of Mr. Cecil\r\nHarmsworth, it has been saved from demolition, and is now opened as a\r\nJohnson museum.\r\n\r\nJohnson was still a bookseller's hack and a comparatively unknown man\r\nwhen, in 1747, at the age of thirty-eight, he started work on his\r\n_Dictionary_. He was then living in Holborn; but next year he moved into\r\nGough Square, and it was here that most of this colossal work was done.\r\nAnd to-day, when you visit that house, you find that all the teeming life\r\nof the last hundred and sixty years has drained out of it completely, and\r\nnothing remains in the old rooms but memories of Johnson and his friends.\r\nHe works there for ever now in the study that used to be his, poring\r\nshort-sightedly over books and papers; and in the queer, sloping-ceilinged\r\ngarret above are his six assistants, copying, hunting out references for\r\nthe _Dictionary_, and busy with all the mechanical part of the\r\nundertaking. You have only to stand there and think of it, and, if you\r\nhave read Boswell and Hawkins, the life of the household as it was in\r\nthose ten years long past refashions itself around you in the magic,\r\nold-world atmosphere of the place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO STAPLE INN.]\r\n\r\nFive publishers joined in commissioning Johnson to compile the\r\n_Dictionary_, and arranged to pay him a sum of \u00a31575, out of which he had\r\nto engage his assistants. \"For the mechanical part,\" writes Boswell, \"he\r\nemployed six amanuenses; and let it be remembered by the natives of North\r\nBritain, to whom he is supposed to have been so hostile, that five of them\r\nwere of that country. There were two Messieurs Macbean; Mr. Shiels; Mr.\r\nStewart, son of Mr. George Stewart, bookseller at Edinburgh; and a Mr.\r\nMaitland. The sixth of these humble assistants was Mr. Peyton, who, I\r\nbelieve, taught French, and published some elementary tracts.\" That upper\r\nroom in Gough Square was fitted up like a counting-house, and each of the\r\nsix workers in it was allotted his separate task. Boswell goes on to\r\ndescribe Johnson's method: \"The words, partly taken from other\r\ndictionaries and partly supplied by himself, having been first written\r\ndown with spaces left between them, he delivered in writing their\r\netymologies, definitions, and various significations. The authorities were\r\ncopied from the books themselves, in which he had marked the passages with\r\na black-lead pencil, the traces of which could easily be effaced. I have\r\nseen several of them in which that trouble had not been taken, so that\r\nthey were just as when used by the copyists. It is remarkable that he was\r\nso attentive in the choice of the passages in which words were authorised\r\nthat one may read page after page of his _Dictionary_ with improvement\r\nand pleasure; and it should not pass unobserved that he has quoted no\r\nauthor whose writings had a tendency to hurt sound religion and\r\nmorality.... He is now to be considered as 'tugging at his oar,' as\r\nengaged in a steady, continued course of occupation, sufficient to employ\r\nall his time for some years, and which was the best preventive of that\r\nconstitutional melancholy which was ever lurking about him, ready to\r\ntrouble his quiet.\"\r\n\r\nIn after years, with his natural, large kindness of disposition, Johnson\r\nretained a sympathetic interest in those six assistants of his. The elder\r\nof the two Macbeans fell at length into great poverty, and Johnson helped\r\nhim by writing a preface to his _System of Ancient Geography_, and\r\nafterwards influenced Lord Thurlow in getting him admitted as a Poor\r\nBrother of the Charterhouse. He had Shiel, who was dying of consumption,\r\nto help him with his _Lives of the Poets_; and when Peyton died almost\r\ndestitute, it was Johnson who paid his funeral expenses.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was \"tugging at his oar\" and making steady headway with the\r\n_Dictionary_, Johnson sought recreation in founding one of his many\r\nliterary clubs--an informal little club that met of evenings in Ivy Lane,\r\nPaternoster Row, and numbered among its members Hawkesworth, who succeeded\r\nJohnson as compiler of Parliamentary debates for the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_, and later edited and wrote most of a bi-weekly, _The\r\nAdventurer_; Dr. Bathurst, who with Johnson and Warton contributed to that\r\n_Adventurer_; and Hawkins, who in due course became one of Johnson's\r\nexecutors and biographers. He had published his satire, _London_, eleven\r\nyears before this; but it was whilst he was living in Gough Square, with\r\nthe _Dictionary_ in full progress, that he wrote and published his only\r\nother great satire, _The Vanity of Human Wishes_, with its references to\r\nthe hope deferred, the hardships of his own life, and the obscurity and\r\npoverty from which he was but now gradually beginning to emerge:--\r\n\r\n  \"When first the college rolls receive his name,\r\n   The young enthusiast quits his ease for fame;\r\n   Resistless burns the fever of renown,\r\n   Caught from the strong contagion of the gown:\r\n   O'er Bodley's dome his future labours spread,\r\n   And Bacon's mansion trembles o'er his head.\r\n   Are these thy views? proceed, illustrious youth,\r\n   And virtue guard thee to the throne of truth!\r\n   Yet should thy soul indulge the generous heat,\r\n   Till captive science yields her last retreat;\r\n   Should reason guide thee with her brightest ray\r\n   And pour on misty doubt resistless day;\r\n   Should no false kindness lure to loose delight,\r\n   Nor praise relax, nor difficulty fright;\r\n   Should tempting novelty thy cell refrain,\r\n   And sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain;\r\n   Should beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart,\r\n   Nor claim the triumph of a lettered heart;\r\n   Should no disease thy torpid veins invade\r\n   Nor melancholy's phantom haunt thy shade;\r\n   Yet hope not life from grief or danger free,\r\n   Nor think the doom of man reversed for thee:\r\n   Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,\r\n   And pause awhile from learning to be wise:\r\n   There mark what ills the scholar's life assail,\r\n   Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail.\r\n   See nations slowly wise, and meanly just,\r\n   To buried merit raise the tardy bust.\r\n   If dreams yet flatter, yet again attend,\r\n   Hear Lydiat's life, and Galileo's end.\"\r\n\r\nHad the Gough Square house been memorable only as the birthplace of the\r\n_Dictionary_, it would have been enough to have given it immortality; for,\r\nas Carlyle says (and Carlyle once went reverently over these rooms, and\r\nwrote a record of his visit), \"Had Johnson left nothing but his\r\n_Dictionary_, one might have traced there a great intellect, a genuine\r\nman. Looking to its clearness of definition, its general solidity,\r\nhonesty, insight, and successful method, it may be called the best of all\r\ndictionaries. There is in it a kind of architectural nobleness; it stands\r\nthere like a great, solid, square-built edifice, finished, symmetrically\r\ncomplete; you judge that a true builder did it.\" But, still while the\r\n_Dictionary_ was going on, shortly after the publication of _The Vanity of\r\nHuman Wishes_, which yielded him \u00a315, Garrick produced his tragedy of\r\n_Irene_ at Drury Lane. It was a failure on the stage; the audience\r\nshrieked \"Murder! murder!\" when the bowstring was placed round the\r\nheroine's neck; but Johnson, feeling that a dramatic author should be more\r\ngaily dressed than it was his wont to appear, sat in a box on the first\r\nnight in a scarlet waistcoat, with rich gold lace, and a gold-laced hat,\r\nand accepted his failure with unruffled calmness; and Dodsley paid him\r\n\u00a3100 for the right to publish the play as a book.\r\n\r\nStill while he was in the thick of the _Dictionary_, he set himself, in\r\n1750, to start _The Rambler_, and you may take it that he was sitting in\r\nhis Gough Square study one night when he wrote that prayer before\r\npublishing his first number:--\r\n\r\n\"Almighty God, the giver of all good things, without whose help all labour\r\nis ineffectual, and without whose grace all wisdom is folly; grant, I\r\nbeseech Thee, that in this undertaking Thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld\r\nfrom me, but that I may promote Thy glory, and the salvation of myself and\r\nothers. Grant this, O Lord, for the sake of Thy Son Jesus Christ. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS]\r\n\r\nHis first number was printed on the 20th March 1750, and he issued it\r\nevery Saturday and Tuesday afterwards for two years. \"This,\" as Boswell\r\nhas it, \"is a strong confirmation of the truth of a remark of his, that 'a\r\nman may write at any time, if he will set himself doggedly to it'; for,\r\nnotwithstanding his constitutional indolence, his depression of spirits,\r\nand his labour in carrying on his _Dictionary_, he answered the stated\r\ncalls of the press twice a week, from the stores of his mind, during all\r\nthat time; having received no assistance, except four billets in No. 10,\r\nby Miss Mulso, now Mrs. Chapone; No. 30, by Miss Catherine Talbot; No. 97,\r\nby Mr. Samuel Richardson; and Nos. 44 and 100, by Mrs. Elizabeth Carter.\"\r\nHe was so pressed for time that he wrote a good many of the essays in such\r\nhaste that he had no opportunity even to read them through again before\r\nthey were printed. One thing that particularly gratified Johnson in\r\nconnection with the _Rambler_ was that his wife said to him, after she had\r\nread a few numbers, \"I thought very well of you before, but I did not\r\nimagine you could have written anything equal to this.\"\r\n\r\nGough Square is hallowed, too, with sadder memories of Johnson's wife, for\r\nshe died here in March 1752; and to the end of his days he never forgot\r\nher or ceased to sorrow for her. She was a plain-featured woman some\r\nyears older than himself, but he always spoke of her with a wonderful\r\ntenderness and love, and as of one who had been beautiful to look upon.\r\nHow deeply he felt her loss is evident not merely from some of his\r\nsayings, but from his letters, and from those _Prayers and Meditations_,\r\nin which he set down his most intimate thoughts and feelings. After his\r\ndeath, this written prayer was found among his papers, dated in the month\r\nafter her passing:--\r\n\r\n    \"_April 26th, 1752, being after 12 at night of the 25th._\r\n\r\n    \"O Lord! Governor of heaven and earth, in whose hands are embodied and\r\n    departed spirits, if Thou hast ordained the souls of the dead to\r\n    minister to the living, and appointed my departed wife to have care of\r\n    me, grant that I may enjoy the good effects of her attention and\r\n    ministration, whether exercised by appearance, impulses, dreams, or in\r\n    any other manner agreeable to Thy government. Forgive my presumption,\r\n    enlighten my ignorance, and however meaner agents are employed, grant\r\n    me the blessed influences of Thy Holy Spirit, through Jesus Christ our\r\n    Lord. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. JOHNSON'S HOUSE. GOUGH SQUARE.]\r\n\r\nYou may stand in the Square to-night, after twelve at night, when all the\r\nwindows of all the other houses are dark, as they were in that night of\r\n1752, and look up at the window in which the solitary light burned then,\r\nwhilst, within, the grief-stricken Johnson sat alone in his study writing\r\ndown that humble, mournful aspiration, and as you look the same light\r\nkindles there and glimmers desolately again for all who have eyes to see\r\nit. Nor was this the only record of his sorrow that was written in that\r\nroom, for you find these notes in his journal a year later:--\r\n\r\n\"_March 28, 1753._ I kept this day as the anniversary of my Tetty's death,\r\nwith prayers and tears in the morning. In the evening I prayed for her\r\nconditionally, if it were lawful.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 23, 1753._ I know not whether I do not too much indulge the vain\r\nlongings of affection; but I hope they intenerate my heart, and that when\r\nI die like my Tetty, this affection will be acknowledged in a happy\r\ninterview, and that in the meantime I am incited by it to piety. I will,\r\nhowever, not deviate too much from common and received methods of\r\ndevotion.\"\r\n\r\nBoswell tells us that he preserved her wedding-ring reverently as long as\r\nhe lived, keeping it in \"a little round wooden box, in the inside of which\r\nhe pasted a slip of paper, thus inscribed by him in fair characters, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  'Eheu!\r\n  Eliz. Johnson,\r\n  Nupta Jul. 9\u00ba, 1736,\r\n  Mortua, eheu!\r\n  Mart. 17\u00ba, 1752.'\"\r\n\r\nSome thought of her, indeed, rises again and again thereafter in those\r\n_Prayers and Meditations_ of his, and so makes this house peculiarly\r\nreminiscent of her. Before Mrs. Johnson's death, Mrs. Anna Williams had\r\nbecome a constant visitor at the house here. She was a poetess in a small\r\nway, daughter of a Welsh physician, and was in London having both her eyes\r\ntreated for cataract. After his wife's death, Johnson gave Mrs. Williams\r\naccommodation in Gough Square whilst her eyes were operated upon; and,\r\nthe operation failing and complete blindness following it, with his usual\r\nbig-hearted humanity he allowed her an apartment in this and each of his\r\nsubsequent homes; and you remember Boswell's complaint of how his\r\nfastidious susceptibilities were outraged by the way in which she felt\r\nround the edges of the cups to see if they were full, when she presided\r\nover the tea-table. In the same spirit, Johnson gave house-room here also,\r\nand elsewhere, to that simplest and most kindly of medical practitioners,\r\nDr. Robert Levett, on whose death, several years later, he wrote the best\r\nof his shorter poems.\r\n\r\nYou get a good idea of his general manner of life in Gough Square from the\r\nnote that Boswell obtained from Francis Barber, Johnson's black servant,\r\nwho wrote that on his wife's death Johnson was \"in great affliction. Mrs.\r\nWilliams was then living in his house, which was in Gough Square. He was\r\nbusy with the _Dictionary_. Mr. Shiels and some others of the gentlemen\r\nwho had formerly written for him used to come about the house. He had then\r\nlittle for himself, but frequently sent money to Mr. Shiels when in\r\ndistress. The friends who visited him at that time were chiefly Dr.\r\nBathurst, and Mr. Diamond, an apothecary in Cork Street, Burlington\r\nGardens, with whom he and Mrs. Williams generally dined every Sunday.\r\nThere were also Mr. Cave; Dr. Hawkesworth; Mr. Rydal, merchant on Tower\r\nHill; Mrs. Masters, the poetess, who lived with Mr. Cave; Mrs. Carter; and\r\nsometimes Mrs. Macaulay; also Mrs. Gardiner, wife of a tallow-chandler on\r\nSnow Hill, not in the learned way, but a worthy good woman; Mr. (now Sir\r\nJoshua) Reynolds; Mr. Miller; Mr. Dodsley; Mr. Bouquet; Mr. Payne, of\r\nPaternoster Row, bookseller; Mr. Strachan the printer; the Earl of Orrery;\r\nLord Southwell; Mr. Garrick.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES BOSWELL]\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after the conclusion of _The Rambler_ that Johnson first\r\nmade the acquaintance of Bennet Langton. He had taken lodgings in a house\r\nthat was frequently visited by Dr. Levett; and, with Johnson's permission,\r\nLevett one day brought Langton to Gough Square, and, says Boswell:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Langton was exceedingly surprised when the sage first appeared. He\r\nhad not received the smallest intimation of his figure, dress, or manner.\r\nFrom perusing his writings, he fancied he should see a decent,\r\nwell-dressed--in short, a remarkably decorous philosopher. Instead of\r\nwhich, down from his bed-chamber, about noon, came, as newly risen, a huge\r\nuncouth figure, with a little dark wig which scarcely covered his head,\r\nand his clothes hanging loose about him. But his conversation was so rich,\r\nso animated, and so forcible, and his religious and political notions so\r\ncongenial with those in which Langton had been educated, that he conceived\r\nfor him that veneration and attachment which he ever preserved.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1753 Johnson \"relieved the drudgery of his _Dictionary_\" by writing\r\nessays for Hawkesworth's _Adventurer_, and in this and the next two years\r\ndid a lot of reviewing and varied hack-work for the magazines and\r\nmiscellanies of his time; and in February 1775 he wrote that nobly\r\nscathing and touching letter to Lord Chesterfield, that is too well known\r\nto need reprinting, but must needs be reprinted here, because it was\r\nwritten from Gough Square, and would make any house from which it was\r\nwritten an honoured and sacred place to all who value the dignity of\r\nliterature and glory in the emancipation of the literary man from the\r\ncondescending benevolence of the private patron:--\r\n\r\n    \"MY LORD,--I have been lately informed, by the proprietor of _The\r\n    World_, that two papers in which my _Dictionary_ is recommended to the\r\n    public were written by your lordship. To be so distinguished is an\r\n    honour which, being very little accustomed to favours from the great,\r\n    I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to acknowledge.\r\n\r\n    \"When, upon some slight encouragement, I first visited your lordship,\r\n    I was overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by the enchantment of\r\n    your address, and could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself\r\n    _Le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre_--that I might obtain that\r\n    regard for which I saw the whole world contending; but I found my\r\n    attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would\r\n    suffer me to continue it. When I had once addressed your lordship in\r\n    public, I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and\r\n    uncourtly scholar can possess. I had done all that I could; and no man\r\n    is well pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.\r\n\r\n    \"Seven years, my lord, have now passed since I waited in your outward\r\n    rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during which time I have been\r\n    pushing on with my work through difficulties, of which it is useless\r\n    to complain, and have brought it, at last, to the verge of\r\n    publication, without one act of assistance, one word of\r\n    encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not\r\n    expect, for I never had a patron before.\r\n\r\n    \"The shepherd in _Virgil_ grew at last acquainted with Love, and found\r\n    him a native of the rocks.\r\n\r\n    \"Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man\r\n    struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground,\r\n    encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to\r\n    take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been\r\n    delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am\r\n    solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I\r\n    hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where\r\n    no benefit has been received, or to be unwilling that the public\r\n    should consider me as owing that to a patron which Providence has\r\n    enabled me to do for myself.\r\n\r\n    \"Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any\r\n    favourer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though I shall\r\n    conclude it, if less be possible, with less; for I have been long\r\n    wakened from that dream of hope, in which I once boasted myself with\r\n    so much exultation,\r\n\r\n      \"My lord, your lordship's most humble,\r\n        \"Most obedient servant,\r\n          \"SAM. JOHNSON.\"\r\n\r\nA few months after this the _Dictionary_ was finished. There had been many\r\ndelays; it was long behind the stipulated time, and the patience of the\r\npublishers was exhausted; but at last Johnson sent the last sheets of the\r\ngreat work to Mr. Miller, the Strand bookseller, who was chiefly\r\nconcerned in the venture, and when the messenger returned from Miller's\r\nshop Johnson asked him, \"Well, what did he say?\" \"Sir,\" answered the\r\nmessenger, \"he said, 'Thank God I have done with him.'\" \"I am glad,\"\r\nreplied Johnson, with a smile, \"that he thanks God for anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of the _Dictionary_ made him at once the most famous man\r\nof letters in London; but he had already spent the money that was paid for\r\nhis labour, and had still to work hard with his pen to make \"provision for\r\nthe day that was passing over him.\" In 1757 he took up again a scheme for\r\nan elaborate edition of Shakespeare with notes, and issued proposals and\r\ninvited subscriptions for it; but it was another nine years before his\r\nShakespeare made its appearance. Among his many visitors in 1758, Dr.\r\nCharles Burney, the father of Fanny Burney, called and \"had an interview\r\nwith him in Gough Square, where he dined and drank tea with him, and was\r\nintroduced to the acquaintance of Mrs. Williams. After dinner, Mr. Johnson\r\nproposed to Mr. Burney to go up with him into his garret, which, being\r\naccepted, he there found about five or six Greek folios, a deal\r\nwriting-desk, and a chair and a half. Johnson, giving his guest the entire\r\nseat, tottered himself on one with only three legs and one arm. Here he\r\ngave Mr. Burney Mrs. Williams's history, and showed him some volumes of\r\nShakespeare already printed, to prove that he was in earnest.\" They\r\nproceeded to criticise Shakespeare's commentators up there, and to discuss\r\nthe controversy then raging between the friends of Pope and Bolingbroke in\r\nconnection with an unauthorised publication of certain of Bolingbroke's\r\nletters to Pope, who was recently dead. And in the April of this same year\r\nJohnson began to write his essays for _The Idler_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHNSON'S CORNER. THE CHESHIRE CHEESE.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, you have a varied and intimate series of pictures, a sort of\r\npanoramic view of the life that Johnson lived in his Gough Square house,\r\nand amid his old surroundings are able to recreate him for yourself in all\r\nhis varying circumstances and changing moods--working there at his\r\n_Dictionary_ and his multifarious writings; sorrowing for his wife;\r\nentertaining his friends; sallying forth morning and evening to walk along\r\nFleet Street to the church of St. Clement Danes, in the Strand, assuming\r\nthat he kept the resolution to do so that is entered at this date in his\r\njournal; and, almost every Sunday afternoon, coming staidly down the steps\r\nwith Mrs. Williams, and setting out to dine with Mr. Diamond, the\r\napothecary of Cork Street; on many evenings strolling along Wine Office\r\nCourt, to forgather with friends in the parlour of the \"Cheshire Cheese,\"\r\nwhere the seat traditionally occupied by him and Goldsmith is still to be\r\nseen; or going farther to a meeting of his club in Ivy Lane. There is a\r\ncapital story told by Hawkins of how one night at that club a suggestion\r\nwas made that they should celebrate the publication of Mrs. Lennox's first\r\nnovel, _The Life of Harriet Stuart_, with a supper at the Devil Tavern, in\r\nFleet Street. Johnson threw himself heart and soul into the proposal, and\r\ndeclared that they would honour the event by spending the whole night in\r\nfestivity. On the evening fixed, at about eight o'clock, Mrs. Lennox and\r\nher husband, and some twenty friends and members of the club, gathered at\r\nthe Devil Tavern, Temple Bar, and, by Johnson's orders, a magnificent hot\r\napple-pie adorned with bay leaves formed a principal item of the menu. He\r\nhimself crowned Mrs. Lennox with laurel; and, true to his resolve, he kept\r\nthe feast going right through the night. \"At 5 A.M.,\" says Hawkins,\r\n\"Johnson's face shone with meridian splendour, though his drink had been\r\nonly lemonade.\" The day was beginning to dawn when they all partook of a\r\n\"second refreshment of coffee,\" and it was broad daylight and eight\r\no'clock before the party broke up, and Johnson made his way back up Fleet\r\nStreet, round into Gough Square, and to the prosaic resumption of work on\r\nthe _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nSoon after starting _The Idler_, Johnson left Gough Square and took rooms\r\nin Staple Inn, where he presently wrote _Rasselas_ in the evenings of one\r\nweek, and so raised \u00a3100, that \"he might defray the expenses of his\r\nmother's funeral, and pay some little debts which she had left.\"\r\n\r\nAll these things had happened, and Johnson had risen into fame and become\r\n\"the great Cham of letters,\" before Boswell had made his acquaintance. The\r\nhistoric meeting between these two did not come about until 1763, and then\r\nit took place at No. 8 Russell Street, Covent Garden--another famous house\r\nthat is fortunately still in existence. It was then occupied by Thomas\r\nDavies, the actor, who had retired from the stage and opened a\r\nbookseller's shop there. He knew Johnson, who frequently visited him, and\r\non his invitation Boswell was there several times in hopes of meeting the\r\ngreat man; again and again it happened that on the days when he was in\r\nwaiting Johnson failed to appear, but in the end his patience was\r\nrewarded, and this is his own account of the interview, taken from notes\r\nhe made of it on the very day of its occurrence:--\r\n\r\n\"At last, on Monday, the 16th of May, when I was sitting in Mr. Davies's\r\nback parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnson\r\nunexpectedly came into the shop; and Mr. Davies, having perceived him\r\nthrough the glass door in the room in which we were sitting, advancing\r\ntowards us, he announced his awful approach to me, somewhat in the manner\r\nof an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet on the\r\nappearance of his father's ghost: 'Look, my lord, it comes!' I found that\r\nI had a very perfect idea of Johnson's figure, from the portrait of him\r\npainted by Sir Joshua Reynolds soon after he had published his\r\n_Dictionary_, in the attitude of sitting in his easy-chair in deep\r\nmeditation. Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and respectfully introduced me\r\nto him. I was much agitated; and recollecting his prejudice against the\r\nScotch, of which I had heard much, I said to Davies, 'Don't tell where I\r\ncome from.' 'From Scotland,' cried Davies roguishly. 'Mr. Johnson,' said\r\nI, 'I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.' He retorted,\r\n'That, sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot\r\nhelp.' This stroke stunned me a good deal; and when we had sat down, I\r\nfelt myself not a little embarrassed and apprehensive of what might come\r\nnext. He then addressed himself to Davies: 'What do you think of Garrick?\r\nHe has refused me an order for the play for Miss Williams, because he\r\nknows the house will be full, and that an order would be worth three\r\nshillings.' Eager to take any opening to get into conversation with him, I\r\nventured to say, 'O sir, I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge such a\r\ntrifle to you.' 'Sir,' said he, with a stern look, 'I have known David\r\nGarrick longer than you have done, and I know no right you have to talk to\r\nme on the subject.' Perhaps I deserved this check; for it was rather\r\npresumptuous in me, an entire stranger, to express any doubt of the\r\njustice of his animadversion upon his old acquaintance and pupil. I now\r\nfelt myself much mortified, and began to think that the hope which I had\r\nlong indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted.\" But he sat on\r\nresolutely, and was rewarded by hearing some of Johnson's conversation, of\r\nwhich he kept notes, that are duly reproduced in the _Life_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE BOSWELL FIRST MET JOHNSON.]\r\n\r\n\"I was highly pleased with the extraordinary vigour of his conversation,\"\r\nhe concludes his account of the meeting, \"and regretted that I was drawn\r\naway from it by an engagement at another place. I had for a part of the\r\nevening been left alone with him, and had ventured to make an observation\r\nnow and then, which he received very civilly; so I was satisfied that,\r\nthough there was a roughness in his manner, there was no ill-nature in his\r\ndisposition. Davies followed me to the door; and when I complained to him\r\na little of the hard blows which the great man had given me, he kindly\r\ntook upon him to console me by saying, 'Don't be uneasy; I can see he\r\nlikes you very well.'\"\r\n\r\nDavies's shop is kept nowadays by a Covent Garden salesman. Instead of\r\nbeing lined with books, it is filled with baskets of fruit and sacks of\r\npotatoes, and the parlour wall and that glass-panelled parlour door are\r\nthrown down, and parlour and shop are all one. But the upper part of the\r\nhouse remains practically unaltered, and with a little imagining you can\r\nrestore the lower to what it was when these walls held the gruff rumbling\r\nof the Doctor's voice, and looked down on the humiliation of Boswell under\r\nthe roguish eyes of Davies and his pretty wife.\r\n\r\nAnother house that has glamorous associations with Johnson is No. 5\r\nAdelphi Terrace, where Garrick lived, and where he died, in a back room on\r\nthe first floor, in 1779. Two years later Johnson was one of a party that\r\ndined there with Mrs. Garrick, and one cannot do better than repeat the\r\nindispensable Boswell's report of the event:--\r\n\r\n\"On Friday, April 20, I spent with him one of the happiest days that I\r\nremember to have enjoyed in the whole course of my life. Mrs. Garrick,\r\nwhose grief for the loss of her husband was, I believe, as sincere as\r\nwounded affection and admiration could produce, had this day, for the\r\nfirst time since his death, a select party of his friends to dine with\r\nher. The company was: Mrs. Hannah More, who lived with her, and whom she\r\ncalled her chaplain; Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, Dr. Burney, Dr. Johnson, and myself. We found ourselves very\r\nelegantly entertained at her house in the Adelphi, where I have passed\r\nmany a pleasing hour with him 'who gladdened life.' She looked well,\r\ntalked of her husband with complacency, and while she cast her eyes on his\r\nportrait, which hung over the chimney-piece, said that 'death was now the\r\nmost agreeable object to her.'... We were all in fine spirits; and I\r\nwhispered to Mrs. Boscawen, 'I believe this is as much as can be made of\r\nlife.'\" After recording the conversation of Johnson and divers of the\r\nothers, Boswell goes on: \"He and I walked away together. We stopped a\r\nlittle by the rails of the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I said to\r\nhim, with some emotion, that I was now thinking of two friends we had lost\r\nwho once lived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. 'Ay,\r\nsir,' said he tenderly, 'and two such friends as cannot be supplied.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOSWELL'S HOUSE. GREAT QUEEN STREET.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1784 Boswell was in London as usual, and saw Johnson,\r\nthen an old man of seventy-five, for the last time. On the 30th June, he\r\nand Johnson dined with Sir Joshua Reynolds in Leicester Square, and when\r\nJohnson went home Boswell accompanied him in Sir Joshua's coach to the\r\nentry of Bolt Court, in Fleet Street, and was so affected at parting that\r\nhe would not accompany him to the house, and they bade each other an\r\naffectionate adieu in the carriage. Johnson stepped out on to the\r\npavement, and, walking briskly, vanished into the yawn of Bolt Court, and,\r\nfor Boswell, into the jaws of death, for he never saw him again. He went\r\nhome to the north two days after, and in December Johnson died.\r\n\r\nOn his annual visits to London Boswell lived in various lodgings; but in\r\nor about 1786 he rented the house, still standing, at 56 Great Queen\r\nStreet, and brought his wife to town with him. They occupied this place\r\nfor some two years; and it is evident from his letters to Bishop Percy and\r\nthe Rev. T. W. Temple that, whilst residing there, he wrote most of the\r\nlast seven years of his _Life of Johnson_. Boswell died in London, in\r\n1795, at No. 122 (formerly 47) Great Portland Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBLAKE AND FLAXMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years before Boswell went to live at 56 Great Queen Street, William\r\nBlake was serving an apprenticeship to James Basire, the well-known\r\nengraver, whose house was close by at No. 31 in the same street. Basire's\r\nresidence has gone the way of all bricks and mortar; but happily Soho\r\nstill preserves the corner house at No. 28 Broad Street, in which Blake\r\nwas born. He was born there on the 28th November 1857, over his father's\r\nhosiery shop, and it was there that the first of his strange visions came\r\nto him; for he used to say that when he was only four years old he one day\r\nsaw the face of God at the window looking in upon him, and the sight set\r\nhim a-screaming. When he was four or five years older, you hear of him\r\ntaking long rambles into the country; and it was on Peckham Rye that other\r\nvisions came to him. Once he saw a tree there \"filled with angels, bright\r\nangelic wings bespangling every bough like stars\"; and once, on a summer\r\nmorning, he saw \"the haymakers at work, and amid them angelic figures\r\nwalking.\" In his matter-of-fact fashion he recounted the first of these\r\ntwo visions on his return home, and his mother had to intervene to prevent\r\nthe honest hosier and conscientious Nonconformist, his father, from\r\nthrashing him for telling a lie.\r\n\r\nAt the age of ten Blake was journeying to and from the house in Broad\r\nStreet to Mr. Paris's academy in the Strand, taking drawing lessons. He\r\nwas already writing poetry, too, and before he was fourteen had written\r\none of the most beautiful and glitteringly imaginative of his lyrics:--\r\n\r\n  \"How sweet I roamed from field to field,\r\n     And tasted all the summer's pride,\r\n   Till I the Prince of Love beheld\r\n     Who in the sunny beams did glide.\r\n\r\n   He showed me lilies for my hair,\r\n     And blushing roses for my brow;\r\n   He led me through his gardens fair\r\n     Where all his golden pleasures grow.\r\n\r\n   With sweet May-dews my wings were wet,\r\n     And Phoebus fired my vocal rage;\r\n   He caught me in his silken net,\r\n     And shut me in his golden cage.\r\n\r\n   He loves to sit and hear me sing,\r\n     Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;\r\n   Then stretches out my golden wing,\r\n     And mocks my loss of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nIn a preface to his first published volume, the _Poetical Sketches_, which\r\ncontains this lyric, his Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter verses, \"My\r\nSilks and fine Array,\" and other lovely songs, he says that all the\r\ncontents were \"commenced in his twelfth, and occasionally resumed by the\r\nauthor till his twentieth year.\" From fourteen till he was twenty-one\r\nBlake was living away from home with his master, Basire, the engraver;\r\nthen he went back to his father's, and commenced to study at the recently\r\nformed Royal Academy, and in 1780 exhibited his first picture there, \"The\r\nDeath of Earl Godwin.\" Marrying in 1782, he set up housekeeping for\r\nhimself at 23 Green Street, Leicester Square, and began to move abroad in\r\nliterary society. Flaxman, already his friend, introduced him to Mrs.\r\nMathew, a lady of blue-stocking tendencies, who held a sort of salon at 27\r\nRathbone Place; and here, in 1784, \"Rainy Day\" Smith made his\r\nacquaintance. \"At Mrs. Mathew's most agreeable conversaziones,\" he says,\r\n\"I first met the late William Blake, to whom she and Mr. Flaxman had been\r\ntruly kind. There I have often heard him read and sing several of his\r\npoems. He was listened to by the company with profound silence, and\r\nallowed by most of his listeners to possess original and extraordinary\r\nmerit.\" He knew nothing of musical technique, but sang some of his verses\r\nto airs that Smith describes as \"singularly beautiful.\" His republican\r\nopinions and general unorthodoxy and daring outspokenness, however, did\r\nnot make for social amenity, and it was not long before he dropped out of\r\nthese elegant circles, and withdrew to his mystic dreamings and the\r\nproduction of paintings and poetry that the majority could not understand.\r\nA strangely beautiful and wonderful Bird of Paradise to break from the\r\nnest over that hosier's shop at the corner of Broad Street, Soho!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLAKE'S HOUSE. SOHO.]\r\n\r\nWhen his father died, in 1784, Blake's brother James took over and\r\ncontinued the business; and in the same year Blake himself opened the shop\r\nnext door (No. 27) as an engraver and printseller, in partnership with\r\nJames Parker, who had been one of his fellow-apprentices under Basire.\r\nHere he had his younger brother, Robert, with him as a pupil; and he\r\nused to say that when Robert died, in 1787, he saw his soul ascend through\r\nthe ceiling, \"clapping its hands for joy.\" Falling out with Parker, Blake\r\nremoved, in this year of his brother's death, to 28 Poland Street, near\r\nby, where he said Robert's spirit remained in communion with him, and\r\ndirected him, \"in a nocturnal vision, how to proceed in bringing out poems\r\nand designs in conjunction\"; and the _Songs of Innocence_, published in\r\n1789, was the result of this inspiration. The method, as Alexander\r\nGilchrist has it, \"consisted in a species of engraving in relief both\r\nwords and designs. The verse was written, and the designs and marginal\r\nembellishments outlined on the copper with an impervious liquid. Then all\r\nthe white parts, or lights (the remainder of the plate, that is), were\r\neaten away with aquafortis or other acid, so that the outline of letter\r\nand design was left prominent, as in stereotype. From these plates he\r\nprinted off in any tint required to be the prevailing (or ground) colour\r\nin his facsimiles; red he used for the letterpress. The page was then\r\ncoloured up by hand in imitation of the original drawing, with more or\r\nless variety of detail in the local hues.\" A process of mixing his colours\r\nwith diluted glue was revealed to him by St. Joseph. Mrs. Blake often\r\nhelped him in tinting the designs, and it was her work to bind the books\r\nin boards. In the same year (1789) he put forth the finest of his long\r\nmystical poems, _The Book of Thel_.\r\n\r\nLeaving Poland Street in 1793, Blake moved across London to Lambeth, and\r\nmade himself a new home at 13 Hercules Buildings. Gilchrist, one of his\r\nearliest biographers, made a mistake in his identification of this house,\r\nand until a year or two ago it was believed that Blake's residence in that\r\nplace had been pulled down. On a recent investigation of the Lambeth\r\nrate-books by the County Council authorities, however, it became clear\r\nthat, instead of being on the west side of the street, as Gilchrist\r\nsupposed, No. 13 was on the east side, next door but one to Hercules Hall\r\nYard. Somewhere between 1830 and 1842 the whole road was renumbered, and\r\nBlake's house had become No. 63, and was in 1890 renumbered again, and\r\nbecame, and is still, No. 23 Hercules Road. Whilst he was living here, Mr.\r\nThomas Butts, of Fitzroy Square, became his most liberal and most constant\r\npatron; and on calling at Hercules Buildings one day, Mr. Butts says he\r\nfound Blake and his wife sitting naked in their summer-house. \"Come in!\"\r\nBlake greeted him. \"It's only Adam and Eve, you know.\" But Mr. Butts never\r\ntook this as evidence of Blake's madness: he and his wife had simply been\r\nreciting passages of _Paradise Lost_ in character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLAKE. 23 HERCULES ROAD.]\r\n\r\nAt Hercules Buildings Blake did a large number of paintings and\r\nengravings, including the 537 coloured drawings for Young's _Night\r\nThoughts_, and some of the greatest of his designs, such as the \"Job\" and\r\n\"Ezekiel\" prints; and here, too, he completed certain of his _Prophetic\r\nBooks_, with their incomprehensible imagery and allegory, and what\r\nSwinburne has called their \"sunless and sonorous gulfs.\" From Hercules\r\nBuildings also came \"Tiger, tiger, burning bright, in the forests of the\r\nnight,\" and the rest of the _Songs of Experience_. Then, in 1800, Hayley,\r\nthe poet of the dull and unreadable _Triumphs of Temper_, persuaded him\r\nto move into the country and settle down in a cottage at Felpham; from\r\nwhich, because he said \"the visions were angry with me at Felpham,\" he\r\nreturned to London early in 1804, and took lodgings on the first floor of\r\n17 South Moulton Street, Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLAKE'S HOUSE. SOUTH MOULTON ST.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at Felpham he must have been working on his _Jerusalem_,\r\nand on _Milton, A Poem in Two Books_, for these were issued shortly after\r\nhis arrival in South Moulton Street. He writes of _Jerusalem_ in one of\r\nhis letters: \"I have written this poem from immediate dictation, twelve,\r\nor sometimes twenty or thirty, lines at a time, without premeditation, and\r\neven against my will\"; and in a later letter, speaking of it as \"the\r\ngrandest poem that this world contains,\" he excuses himself by remarking,\r\n\"I may praise it, since I dare not pretend to be any other than the\r\nsecretary--the authors are in eternity.\" Much of _Jerusalem_ is turgid,\r\nobscure, chaotic, and so impossible to understand that Mr. Chesterton\r\ndeclares that when Blake said \"that its authors were in eternity, one can\r\nonly say that nobody is likely to go there to get any more of their work.\"\r\nBut it is in this poem that Blake introduces those verses \"To the Jews,\"\r\nsetting forth that Jerusalem once stood in--\r\n\r\n  \"The fields from Islington to Marybone,\r\n     To Primrose Hill and Saint John's Wood,\"\r\n\r\nand that then--\r\n\r\n  \"The Divine Vision still was seen,\r\n     Still was the human form divine;\r\n   Weeping in weak and mortal clay,\r\n     O Jesus! still the form was Thine.\r\n\r\n   And Thine the human face; and Thine\r\n     The human hands, and feet, and breath,\r\n   Entering through the gates of birth,\r\n     And passing through the gates of death\";\r\n\r\nand in _Jerusalem_ you have his lines \"To the Deists,\" the first version\r\nof his ballad of the Grey Monk, with its great ending:--\r\n\r\n  \"For a tear is an intellectual thing,\r\n   And a sigh is the sword of an Angel King,\r\n   And the bitter groan of a martyr's woe\r\n   Is an arrow from the Almighty's bow.\"\r\n\r\nFor my part, I wish it were possible for some of our living poets to go\r\nagain to those authors in eternity and get some more of such stuff as\r\nthis, even if we had to have it embedded in drearier lumps of nonsense\r\nthan you find in _Jerusalem_.\r\n\r\nBlake's wife, daughter of a market-gardener, a woman so uneducated that\r\nshe had to sign the marriage register with her mark, was not only an\r\nexcellent housekeeper and domestic drudge, but was in perfect sympathy\r\nwith him in his work, and had the greatest faith in his visions. Moses,\r\nJulius C\u00e6sar, the Builder of the Pyramids, David, Uriah, Bathsheba,\r\nSolomon, Mahomet, Joseph, and Mary--these were among Blake's spiritual\r\nvisitants at South Moulton Street. They came and sat to him, and he worked\r\nat their portraits, \"looking up from time to time as though he had a real\r\nsitter before him.\" Sometimes he would leave off abruptly, and observe in\r\nmatter-of-fact tones, \"I can't go on. It is gone; I must wait till it\r\nreturns\"; or, \"It has moved; the mouth is gone\"; or, \"He frowns. He is\r\ndispleased with my portrait of him.\" If any one criticised and objected to\r\nthe likeness he would reply calmly, \"It _must_ be right. I saw it so.\" In\r\nall probability he meant no more than that he conjured up these sitters to\r\nhis mind's eye; but his friends took him literally, and he acquiesced in\r\ntheir doing so, and has been dubbed a madman in consequence.\r\n\r\nMany times his wife would get up in the nights \"when he was under his\r\nvery fierce inspirations, which were as if they would tear him asunder,\r\nwhile he was yielding himself to the Muse, or whatever else it could be\r\ncalled, sketching and writing. And so terrible a task did this seem to be\r\nthat she had to sit motionless and silent, only to stay him mentally,\r\nwithout moving hand or foot; this for hours, and night after night.\" It is\r\nnot easy to realise that this burning, fiery spirit did once live in these\r\nSouth Moulton Street rooms, surrounded by his vivid and terrific\r\nimaginings, and then could pass out of it and leave it looking so dull and\r\ndecorous, so ordinary, so entirely commonplace. But here he indubitably\r\nlived, so discouraged by neglect and hampered by poverty that he could not\r\nafford to issue any more large books like the _Jerusalem_, and in 1809\r\nmade a desperate attempt to appeal to the public by holding an exhibition\r\nof his frescoes and drawings on the first floor of his brother's hosiery\r\nshop in Broad Street. Very few visitors attended; but among the few was\r\nLamb's friend, Crabb Robinson, and when he went he had the room to\r\nhimself. He paid for admission, recognised that these pictures were the\r\nwork of no ordinary artist, and bought four of the catalogues, one of\r\nwhich he sent to Lamb; and when, on leaving, he asked the custodian\r\nwhether he might come again free, James Blake, delighted at having a\r\nvisitor, and one, moreover, who had bought something, cried, \"Oh yes--free\r\nas long as you live!\" But the exhibition was a failure. The popular\r\npainters of Blake's day were Reynolds, Gainsborough, and men of their\r\nschools. Blake was born out of his time, and contemporary society had\r\nnothing in common with him--no comprehension of his aim or his\r\noutlook--and dismissed him as an astonishing lunatic. When some drawings\r\nof his were shown to George III., his Majesty could only gaze at them\r\nhelplessly and ejaculate a testy \"Take them away! take them away!\" The\r\nnoble designs for Blair's _Grave_, and the frescoes of _The Canterbury\r\nPilgrimage_, were among the important works done at South Moulton Street,\r\nwhich Blake quitted in 1821, making his last change of residence to 3\r\nFountain Court, Strand--a house kept by his brother-in-law, Baines. Here\r\nhe occupied a room on the first floor for some six years, and when he was\r\nnearing his seventieth year, died, after a short illness, on Sunday, the\r\n12th August 1827. He lay dying in his plain back room, serene and\r\ncheerful, singing songs to melodies that were the inspiration of the\r\nmoment; towards evening he fell silent, and passed quietly away, a poor\r\nwoman, a neighbour who had come in to sit with his wife, saying\r\nafterwards, \"I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed\r\nangel.\"\r\n\r\nYou have only to look at the portraits of Blake, at the broad\r\nforehead--the forehead of a revolutionary, as he himself said--the\r\nsensitive mouth, the large, intent, vision-haunted eyes, to know that his\r\noutward appearance fairly adequately revealed the manner of man that he\r\nreally was. He was under five feet six in height and thick-set, but so\r\nwell proportioned that he did not strike people as short. \"He had an\r\nupright carriage,\" says Gilchrist, \"and a good presence; he bore himself\r\nwith dignity, as not unconscious of his natural claims. The head and face\r\nwere strongly stamped with the power and character of the man. There was\r\na great volume of brain in that square, massive head, that piled-up brow,\r\nvery full and rounded at the temples, where, according to phrenologists,\r\nideality or imagination resides. His eyes were fine ('wonderful eyes,'\r\nsome one calls them), prominently set, but bright, spiritual,\r\nvisionary--not restless or wild, but with a look of clear, heavenly\r\nexaltation. The eyes of some of the old men in his _Job_ recall his own to\r\nsurviving friends. His nose was insignificant as to size, but had that\r\npeculiarity which gives to a face an expression of fiery energy, as of a\r\nhigh-mettled steed--a little _clenched_ nostril, a nostril that opened as\r\nfar as it could, but was tied down at one end. His mouth was wide, the\r\nlips not full, but tremulous, and expressive of the great sensibility\r\nwhich characterised him. He was short-sighted, as the prominence of his\r\neyes indicated--a prominence in keeping with the faculty for languages,\r\naccording to phrenologists again. He wore glasses only occasionally.\" His\r\npoverty forced him to study economy in the matter of dress. Indoors he was\r\nnot slovenly, but generally wore a threadbare old suit, the grey trousers\r\nof which had been rubbed black and shiny in front like a mechanic's. When\r\nhe walked abroad he was more careful, and dressed plainly but well,\r\nsomething in the style of an old-fashioned tradesman, in black\r\nknee-breeches and buckles, black worsted stockings, shoes that tied, and a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat.\r\n\r\nBut for a memorable description of Blake in his habit as he lived, you\r\nmust read this letter that was written to Gilchrist by Samuel Palmer, who\r\nknew him intimately in his latter years:--\r\n\r\n\"Blake, once known, could never be forgotten.... In him you saw at once\r\nthe maker, the inventor; one of the few in any age; a fitting companion\r\nfor Dante. He was a man 'without a mask'; his aim single, his path\r\nstraightforwards, and his wants few; so he was free, noble, and happy. His\r\nvoice and manner were quiet, yet all awake with intellect. Above the\r\ntricks of littleness, or the least taint of affectation, with a natural\r\ndignity which few would have dared to affront, he was gentle and\r\naffectionate, loving to be with little children and talk about them. 'That\r\nis heaven,' he said to a friend, leading him to a window and pointing to a\r\ngroup of them at play.\r\n\r\n\"Declining, like Socrates, whom in many respects he resembled, the common\r\nobjects of ambition, and pitying the scuffle to obtain them, he thought no\r\none could be truly great who had not humbled himself 'even as a little\r\nchild.' This was a subject he loved to dwell upon and to illustrate. His\r\neye was the finest I ever saw; brilliant, but not roving, clear and\r\nintent, yet susceptible; it flashed with genius, or melted in tenderness.\r\nIt could also be terrible.... Nor was the mouth less expressive, the lips\r\nflexible and quivering with feeling. I can yet recall it when, on one\r\noccasion, dwelling upon the exquisite beauty of the parable of the\r\nProdigal, he began to repeat a part of it; but at the words, 'When he was\r\nyet a great way off his father saw him,' he could go no further; his voice\r\nfaltered, and he was in tears.\r\n\r\n\"He was one of the few to be met with in our passage through life who are\r\nnot in some way or other double-minded and inconsistent with themselves;\r\none of the very few who cannot be depressed by neglect, and to whose name\r\nrank and station could add no lustre. Moving apart, in a sphere above the\r\nattraction of worldly honours, he did not accept greatness, but conferred\r\nit. He ennobled poverty, and, by his conversation and the influence of his\r\ngenius, made two small rooms in Fountain Court more attractive than the\r\nthreshold of princes.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Blake's warmest friends for many years was the great sculptor, John\r\nFlaxman. With none of Blake's lawless, glowing imagination, Flaxman's\r\ndrawings in his illustrations to Homer, and his designs on some of the\r\nWedgwood pottery, have a classical correctness--a cold, exquisite beauty\r\nof outline--that are more suggestive of the chisel than of the pencil or\r\nthe brush; and it is in the splendid sculptures with which he has\r\nbeautified Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's, and many other of our cathedrals\r\nand churches that his genius found its highest expression. In his work as\r\nan artist Blake was largely influenced by Flaxman. They and Stothard used\r\nto meet at Mrs. Mathew's; but there came a day when the friendship between\r\nthese three was broken. Blake thought Flaxman had appropriated one of his\r\ndesigns, and there seems no doubt that Stothard did so, on the prompting\r\nof an unscrupulous picture-dealer; and you have Blake lampooning them\r\nboth, as well as Hayley, with whom he had also fallen out, in epigrams\r\nthat were not always just, and probably represented nothing worse than a\r\npassing mood, as thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"My title as a genius thus is proved:\r\n   Not praised by Hayley, nor by Flaxman loved.\"\r\n\r\n  \"I found them blind, I taught them how to see,\r\n   And now they know neither themselves nor me.\"\r\n\r\n_To Flaxman._\r\n\r\n  \"You call me mad; 'tis folly to do so,--\r\n   To seek to turn a madman to a foe.\r\n   If you think as you speak, you are an ass;\r\n   If you do not, you are but what you was.\"\r\n\r\n_To the same._\r\n\r\n  \"I mock thee not, though I by thee am mocked;\r\n   Thou call'st me madman, but I call thee blockhead.\"\r\n\r\nFlaxman was not, like Blake, a born Londoner, but his family came from\r\nYork, and settled down in London when he was six months old. His father\r\nhad a shop in New Street, Covent Garden, where he made and sold plaster\r\ncasts. Flaxman emerged from a sickly childhood, and developed into a\r\nsufficiently wiry and energetic man, though he remained feeble in\r\nappearance, so high-shouldered as to seem almost deformed, with a head too\r\nlarge for his body, and a queer sidelong gait in walking. He married in\r\n1782, and, after living for five years in a very small house at 27 Wardour\r\nStreet, Soho--where he was elected collector of the watch-rate for the\r\nparish--he and his wife went to Italy, and spent seven years in Rome.\r\nWhilst he was there he fulfilled a commission for Romney, and collected\r\nand sent over to England a selection of casts from the antique, that\r\nRomney required for the use of students in his Hampstead painting-room.\r\n\r\nReturning from Italy in 1794, Flaxman took up residence at 17 Buckingham\r\nStreet, Euston Road, and lived here through all his most famous years,\r\ntill he died in 1826. Blake visited him here, and Haydon, and other of his\r\nartistic circle; for though he went little into society, he was\r\nunpretentiously hospitable, fond of entertaining his chosen friends,\r\ngreatly esteemed and beloved by his pupils, models, and servants, and the\r\npoor of the neighbourhood, especially the children. He went about among\r\nthe latter habitually, filling his sketch-book with drawings of them, and\r\ninvariably carrying a pocketful of coppers to drop into the small grubby\r\nhands that were ready to receive them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLAXMAN'S HOUSE. BUCKINGHAM STREET. EUSTON ROAD.]\r\n\r\nThe district hereabouts has degenerated since Flaxman's day. His house was\r\ndull, insignificant, rather mean-looking, and now it looks more so than\r\never, amid its grimy surroundings--a pinched, old, dreary little house,\r\nthat is yet transfigured when you remember the glorious visitors who have\r\ncrossed its threshold, and that it was at this same dead door the postman\r\nknocked one day near the end of September 1800 and delivered this letter\r\nfrom Blake, who was then newly gone out of London and had not had time to\r\nbegin to grow tired of his cottage at Felpham:--\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR SCULPTOR OF ETERNITY,--We are safe arrived at our cottage, which\r\n    is more beautiful than I thought it, and more convenient.... Mr.\r\n    Hayley received us with his usual brotherly affection. I have begun to\r\n    work. Felpham is a sweet place for study, because it is more spiritual\r\n    than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden gates; her\r\n    windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of celestial inhabitants\r\n    are more distinctly heard, and their forms more distinctly seen; and\r\n    my cottage is also a shadow of their houses. My wife and sister are\r\n    both well, courting Neptune for an embrace....\r\n\r\n    \"And now begins a new life, because another covering of earth is\r\n    shaken off. I am more famed in heaven for my works than I could well\r\n    conceive. In my brain are studies and chambers filled with books and\r\n    pictures of old, which I wrote and painted in ages of eternity before\r\n    my mortal life; and these works are the delight and study of\r\n    archangels. Why then should I be anxious about the riches and fame of\r\n    mortality? The Lord our Father will do for us and with us according to\r\n    His divine will, for our good.\r\n\r\n    \"You, O dear Flaxman, are a sublime archangel--my friend and companion\r\n    from eternity. In the divine bosom is our dwelling-place. I look back\r\n    into the regions of reminiscence, and behold our ancient days, before\r\n    this earth appeared in its vegetable mortality to my mortal vegetated\r\n    eyes. I see our houses of eternity, which can never be separated,\r\n    though our mortal vehicles should stand at the remotest corners of\r\n    heaven from each other.\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, my best friend. Remember me and my wife in love and\r\n    friendship to our dear Mrs. Flaxman, whom we ardently desire to\r\n    entertain beneath our thatched roof of rusted gold.\"\r\n\r\nLater, when they quarrelled, Flaxman was not an archangel, but a blockhead\r\nand an ass; but that quarrel is not to be taken too seriously. Their\r\nhouses of eternity were not separated, though their mortal vehicles were\r\nestranged; and it was on hearing Flaxman was dead that Blake said finely,\r\n\"I can never think of death but as a going out of one room into another.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA HAMPSTEAD GROUP\r\n\r\n\r\nOut at Hampstead you may still visit what was once that studio of Romney's\r\nto which Flaxman sent his collection of plaster casts from Italy. It had\r\nbeen a favourite idea of Romney's, his son tells us, \"to form a complete\r\nGallery of Casts, and to open it to any youths of respectability,\" and in\r\nhis closing years, after he had removed to Hampstead, he carried out his\r\nwish, to some extent, with Flaxman's aid, and had three pupils working in\r\nhis studio there, copying the casts and studying under him. The house he\r\noccupied from 1796 to 1799 is now the Holly Bush Inn; he bought a piece of\r\nland at the back of it, and on this built himself a studio and gallery,\r\nwhich now form part of the Hampstead Constitutional Club. \"It was to\r\nHampstead that Hayley's friend Romney, the painter, retired in the decline\r\nof his life,\" writes J. T. Smith, in _Nollekens and his Times_, \"when he\r\nbuilt a dining-room close to his kitchen, with a buttery hatch opening\r\ninto it, so that he and his friends might enjoy beef-steaks, hot and hot,\r\nupon the same plan as the members of the Beef-steak Club are supplied at\r\ntheir room in the Lyceum.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMNEY'S HOUSE. HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nThough Romney was then in the decline of his life, he was at the height of\r\nhis fame. He had married at the age of nineteen, and six years later set\r\nout for London, leaving his wife behind at Kendal. He had no intention of\r\ndeserting her, but in London his genius soon won recognition, he began to\r\nmove in good society, and partly because Sir Joshua Reynolds had once said\r\nthat \"marriage spoilt an artist,\" partly because he became infatuated with\r\nNelson's enchantress, Lady Hamilton, he neither brought his wife to\r\nLondon, nor visited her, nor ever saw her again until he was dying. On\r\nApril 28, 1799, Hayley called on him for the last time at Hampstead, and\r\nthought that \"increasing weakness of body and mind afforded only a gloomy\r\nprospect for the residue of his life.\" Then in July Flaxman saw him, and\r\nsays in one of his letters, \"I and my father dined at Mr. Romney's at\r\nHampstead last Sunday, by particular invitation, and were received in the\r\nmost cordial manner; but, alas! I was grieved to see so noble a collection\r\nin a state so confused, so mangled, and prepared, I fear, for worse, and\r\nnot better.\" Very soon after this Romney left London for ever, and\r\nreturned to Kendal and the wife he had neglected since the days of his\r\nobscure youth, and early in 1801, by his directions, \"the collection of\r\ncastes from the antique, a very fine skeleton, and other artistic\r\nproperties of George Romney, at his late residence, Hollybush Hill,\r\nHampstead,\" were sold by Messrs. Christie.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his wife had pardoned him and was caring for him. \"Old, nearly\r\nmad, and quite desolate,\" writes Fitzgerald, \"he went back to her, and she\r\nreceived him and nursed him till he died. This quiet act of hers is worth\r\nall Romney's pictures!--even as a matter of art, I am sure.\" It is this\r\nbeautiful devotion of hers that gave Tennyson a subject for one of his\r\nlater poems, _Romney's Remorse_; in which the dying painter, rousing out\r\nof delirium, says:--\r\n\r\n                            \"There--you spill\r\n  The drops upon my forehead. Your hand shakes.\r\n  I am ashamed. I am a trouble to you,\r\n  Could kneel for your forgiveness. Are they tears?\r\n  For me--they do me too much grace--for me?...\r\n  My curse upon the Master's apothegm,\r\n  That wife and children drag an artist down!\r\n  This seemed my lodestar in the Heaven of Art,\r\n  And lured me from the household fire on earth....\r\n                            This Art, that harlot-like,\r\n  Seduced me from you, leaves me harlot-like,\r\n  Who love her still, and whimper, impotent\r\n  To win her back before I die--and then--\r\n  Then in the loud world's bastard judgment day\r\n  One truth will damn me with the mindless mob,\r\n  Who feel no touch of my temptation, more\r\n  Than all the myriad lies that blacken round\r\n  The corpse of every man that gains a name:\r\n  'This model husband, this fine artist!' Fool,\r\n  What matters! Six feet deep of burial mould\r\n  Will dull their comments! Ay, but when the shout\r\n  Of His descending peals from Heaven, and throbs\r\n  Thro' earth and all her graves, if _He_ should ask\r\n  'Why left you wife and children? for My sake,\r\n  According to My word?' and I replied,\r\n  'Nay, Lord, for _Art_,' why, that would sound so mean\r\n  That all the dead who wait the doom of Hell\r\n  For bolder sins than mine, adulteries,\r\n  Wife-murders--nay, the ruthless Mussulman\r\n  Who flings his bowstrung Harem in the sea,\r\n  Would turn and glare at me, and point and jeer\r\n  And gibber at the worm who, living, made\r\n  The wife of wives a widow-bride, and lost\r\n  Salvation for a sketch....\r\n  O let me lean my head upon your breast.\r\n  'Beat, little heart,' on this fool brain of mine.\r\n  I once had friends--and many--none like you.\r\n  I love you more than when we married. Hope!\r\n  O yes, I hope, or fancy that, perhaps,\r\n  Human forgiveness touches heaven, and thence--\r\n  For you forgive me, you are sure of that--\r\n  Reflected, sends a light on the forgiven.\"\r\n\r\nAnother famous artist who is closely associated with Hampstead was John\r\nConstable. In 1820, writing to his friend, the Rev. John Fisher\r\n(afterwards Archdeacon Fisher), he says, \"I have settled my wife and\r\nchildren comfortably at Hampstead\"; and a little later he writes, again to\r\nFisher, \"My picture is getting on, and the frame will be here in three\r\nweeks or a fortnight.... I now fear (for my family's sake) I shall never\r\nmake a popular artist, _a gentleman and ladies painter_. But I am spared\r\nmaking a fool of myself, and your hand stretched forth teaches me to value\r\nwhat I possess (if I may say so), and this is of more consequence than\r\ngentlemen and ladies can well imagine.\" He was then living at No. 2 Lower\r\nTerrace, a small house of two storeys, and writes from that address, again\r\nto Fisher, on the 4th August 1821, \"I am as much here as possible with my\r\nfamily. My placid and contented companion and her three infants are well.\r\nI have got a room at a glazier's where is my large picture, and at this\r\nlittle place I have many small works going on, for which purpose I have\r\ncleared a shed in the garden, which held sand, coals, mops and brooms, and\r\nhave made it a workshop. I have done a good deal here.\" Lower Terrace is\r\nwithin a few minutes' walk of the Heath, the scenery of which appears in\r\nso many of Constable's paintings. He removed presently to Charlotte\r\nStreet, Fitzroy Square; one of his pictures exhibited in the Louvre made\r\nhim famous in France, and his fame was spreading in England when he went\r\nback to Hampstead in 1826, and after staying for a while at 25 Downshire\r\nHill (which has since been rebuilt) was \"at length fixed,\" as he wrote to\r\nFisher, \"in a comfortable little house at Well Walk, Hampstead.... So\r\nhateful is moving about to me that I could gladly exclaim, 'Here let me\r\ntake my everlasting rest.' This house is to my wife's heart's content; it\r\nis situated on an eminence at the back of the spot in which you saw us,\r\nand our little drawing-room commands a view unsurpassed in Europe from\r\nWestminster Abbey to Gravesend. The dome of St. Paul's in the air seems to\r\nrealise Michael Angelo's words on seeing the Pantheon--'I will build such\r\na thing in the sky.'\" In Constable's time the house was not numbered, but\r\nit has been identified as the present No. 40, and after his wife's death\r\nhe kept it as an occasional residence until he died in 1837. He is buried\r\nnot far from it, in the Hampstead Churchyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN KEATS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTABLE. CHARLOTTE STREET.]\r\n\r\nIn the same churchyard is buried Joanna Baillie, who spent the last\r\nforty-five years of her life at Bolton House, Windmill Hill, opposite the\r\nHollybush Inn, and here Wordsworth, Rogers, and Scott were among her\r\nvisitors. Other famous Hampstead residents buried in this churchyard are\r\nMrs. Barbauld, who lived in Church Row, then near the foot of Rosslyn\r\nHill, and died in John Street; Sir Walter Besant, who died at Frognal End,\r\nnear the top of Frognal Gardens; and George du Maurier, who lived for\r\ntwenty-five years in Church Row and at New Grove House, by Whitestone\r\nPond, and dying in 1896, a year after he left Hampstead, was brought back\r\nhere to be buried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOANNA BAILLIE. WINDMILL HILL. HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nIn the house at the corner of Prince Arthur Road and the High Street, that\r\nis now occupied by the Hampstead Subscription Library, Clarkson Stanfield\r\nmade his home for many years. He did notable work as a landscape and sea\r\npainter and became a Royal Academician, but was best known and most\r\nsuccessful as a scenic artist for the theatre, and brought the art of\r\nscene-painting to a higher level than it had ever reached before. His more\r\nambitious pictures are in private collections, however, his stage scenery\r\nhas had its day, and I suppose most of us remember him better as one of\r\nDickens's most familiar friends. He painted the scenery for Wilkie\r\nCollins's play, _The Lighthouse_, when Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Mark\r\nLemon, and others of their circle produced it at Tavistock House, and for\r\nother of the plays that Dickens staged there in his \"smallest theatre in\r\nthe world\"; and Dickens's letters are sown with references to him. Writing\r\nto an American friend describing the Christmas sports he had been holding\r\nat his house, Dickens says he has purchased the entire stock-in-trade of a\r\nconjuror, and that \"in those tricks which require a confederate I am\r\nassisted (by reason of his imperturbable good humour) by Stanfield, who\r\nalways does his part exactly the wrong way, to the unspeakable delight of\r\nall beholders. We come out on a small scale to-night\" (31st December 1842)\r\n\"at Forster's, where we see the old year out and the new one in.\" On the\r\n16th January 1844 (putting _Martin Chuzzlewit_ aside) he is writing to\r\nForster, \"I had written you a line pleading Jonas and Mrs. Gamp, but this\r\nfrosty day tempts me sorely. I am distractingly late; but I look at the\r\nsky, think of Hampstead, and feel hideously tempted. Don't come with Mac\r\nand fetch me. I couldn't resist if you did\"; and a month later, on the\r\n18th February, \"Stanfield and Mac have come in, and we are going to\r\nHampstead to dinner. I leave Betsy Prig as you know, so don't you make a\r\nscruple about leaving Mrs. Harris. We shall stroll leisurely up to give\r\nyou time to join us, and dinner will be on the table at Jack Straw's at\r\nfour\"; and in less than a month, on the 5th March, \"Sir, I\r\nwill--he--he--he--he--he--he--I will NOT eat with you, either at your own\r\nhouse or the club. But the morning looks bright, and a walk to Hampstead\r\nwould suit me marvellously. If you should present yourself at my gate\r\n(bringing the R.A.'s along with you) I shall not be sapparised. So no more\r\nat this writing from poor MR. DICKENS.\" In June of the same year he sent\r\nForster the proof of a preface he had written to a book by a poor\r\ncarpenter named Overs, saying, \"I wish you would read this, and give it me\r\nagain when we meet at Stanfield's to-day\"; and, still in the same year,\r\n\"Stanny\" is one of the friends he wishes Forster to invite to his chambers\r\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields to hear a reading of _The Chimes_ before it is\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nNo part of London is richer in literary and artistic associations than\r\nHampstead. At the \"Upper Flask\" tavern, now known as the \"Upper Heath,\"\r\nPope, Addison, Steele, Congreve, Hogarth and the other members of the\r\nKit-Kat club used to meet in the eighteenth century, and Hogarth and\r\nAddison and his friends frequently resorted to the \"Bull and Bush\" at\r\nNorth End. Akenside lived for a while in Hampstead, and after he had left\r\nit went to stay occasionally with his friend Mr. Dyson at Golder's Hill,\r\nand was staying there in 1758 when he wrote his _Ode on recovering from a\r\nfit of sickness in the Country_, beginning:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thy verdant scenes, O Goulder's Hill,\r\n   Once more I seek, a languid guest.\"\r\n\r\nGay often went to Hampstead to drink the waters, at the Pump Room, in Well\r\nWalk; Dr. Arbuthnot lived in Hampstead, where Swift and Pope were among\r\nhis visitors; Fuseli lodged in Church Row; Dr. Johnson's wife spent some\r\nof her summer holidays at a cottage near the entrance to the Priory, and\r\nthe Doctor would tear himself away from his loved Fleet Street to pass an\r\noccasional day or two there with her; and of recent years Robert Louis\r\nStevenson stayed with Sidney Colvin at Abernethy House, Mount Vernon, and\r\nat that time Stevenson, who was then twenty-four, so far conformed to the\r\nproprieties as to go about in \"a frock coat and tall hat, which he had\r\nonce worn at a wedding.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STANFIELD'S HOUSE. HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nTennyson's mother had a house in Flask Walk; when Edward Fitzgerald was\r\nin London, Tennyson introduced him to Dickens, and these three, taking\r\nThackeray with them, drove out together to Hampstead Heath. Relics of Dick\r\nTurpin are preserved at the Spaniards Inn, a quaint, old-world hostelry\r\nthat has in different generations entertained Goldsmith, Gainsborough, Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds, Garrick and Constable, as well as Dickens and many of his\r\nfamiliars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UPPER FLASK. FROM THE BOWLING GREEN.]\r\n\r\nBut more intimately than with any other of the immortals Hampstead has\r\ncome to be associated with Keats and Leigh Hunt--with Keats in particular.\r\nHe was born, a good Cockney, in Moorfields, over his father's livery\r\nstables, and in 1816 went to live with his brother Tom at No. 1 Well Walk,\r\nnext door to the \"Green Man,\" which has been succeeded by the Wells\r\nTavern, and in his room here, on the 18th November 1816, when he was\r\none-and-twenty, wrote a sonnet _To My Brothers_:--\r\n\r\n  \"Small, busy flames play through the fresh-laid coals,\r\n     And their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep\r\n     Like whispers of the household gods that keep\r\n   A gentle empire o'er fraternal souls.\r\n   And while for rhymes I search around the poles,\r\n     Your eyes are fixed, as in poetic sleep,\r\n     Upon the lore so voluble and deep\r\n   That aye at fall of night our care condoles.\r\n\r\n   This is your birthday, Tom, and I rejoice\r\n     That thus it passes smoothly, quietly:\r\n   Many such eves of gently whispering noise\r\n     May we together pass, and calmly try\r\n   What are this world's true joys--ere the great Voice\r\n     From its fair face shall bid our spirits fly.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1818 Keats moved to another part of Hampstead, and lodged with his\r\nfriend, Charles Armitage Brown, a retired merchant, at Wentworth Place,\r\nnow known as Lawn Bank, in John Street, which was the other day, for no\r\nsufficient reason, renamed Keats Grove. At that date Wentworth Place was\r\ndivided into two houses, Brown renting one, and Wentworth Dilke occupying\r\nthe other; and when the Dilkes were away from home they left their house\r\nin the possession of Mrs. Brawne, her son, and two daughters, the elder of\r\nthese daughters being the Fanny Brawne of Keats's piteous love romance.\r\nThough he finished the writing of it, and wrote the preface to it, on a\r\nholiday at Teignmouth, _Endymion_ was published, and most of it had been\r\nwritten, whilst he was at Wentworth Place, and under this roof also he\r\nwrote his _Eve of St. Agnes_, _Isabella_, _Hyperion_, and the _Ode to a\r\nNightingale_. As every one knows, the publication of _Endymion_ brought\r\nhim little but ridicule and abuse from the reviewers; but, much as this\r\nmust have wounded and mortified his sensitive nature, it was so far from\r\nbeing the cause of his death, as some sentimentalists said it was, that,\r\nas you may gather from his correspondence, it did not even discourage him.\r\nThe _Quarterly_ snubbed him as a copyist of Leigh Hunt, professed to find\r\n_Endymion_ so tedious as to be almost unreadable, and saw nothing in it\r\nbut \"calm, settled, imperturbable, drivelling idiocy\"; _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_, referring to his having qualified as a surgeon, sneered \"Back\r\nto the shop, Mr. John, stick to plasters, pills, ointment-boxes;\" and the\r\nmajority of critics were equally unappreciative. Byron dubbed him \"a\r\ntadpole of the Lakes,\" and in divers letters to John Murray says, \"There\r\nis such a trash of Keats and the like upon my tables that I am ashamed to\r\nlook at them. No more Keats, I entreat.... Of the praises of the little\r\ndirty blackguard Keats in the _Edinburgh_ I shall observe, as Johnson did\r\nwhen Sheridan the actor got a pension, 'What, has _he_ got a pension? Then\r\nit is time that I should give up _mine_.' At present, all the men they\r\nhave ever praised are degraded by that insane article. Why don't they\r\nreview and praise _Solomon's Guide to Health_? It is better sense and as\r\nmuch poetry as Johnny Keats.\" After Keats was dead, Byron changed his\r\nopinions somewhat, and was anxious that his disparagements of him should\r\nbe suppressed. \"You know very well,\" he writes to Murray, \"that I did not\r\napprove of Keats's poetry, or principles of poetry, or of his abuse of\r\nPope; but as he is dead, omit all that it said about him in any MSS. of\r\nmine, or publication. His _Hyperion_ is a fine monument, and will keep his\r\nname\"; and he added later, \"His fragment of _Hyperion_ seems actually\r\ninspired by the Titans, and is as sublime as \u00c6schylus. He is a loss to our\r\nliterature.\"\r\n\r\nKeats was too fully occupied with the writing of other poems, with the\r\nglowing raptures and black despairs of his passion for Fanny Brawne, and\r\nthe anxieties attendant upon the illness that was already wearing him\r\ndown, to give overmuch of his thoughts to the attacks of his critics;\r\nmoreover, he found consolation in the society and friendship of such men\r\nas Cowden Clarke, Wentworth Dilke (who founded the _Athen\u00e6um_), John\r\nHamilton Reynolds, Haydon the painter, and Leigh Hunt, whom he frequently\r\nvisited at that cottage of his in the Vale of Health, which ought never to\r\nhave been demolished. For it was the meeting-place, too, of Keats and\r\nShelley, and within it on one occasion, according to Cowden Clarke, Leigh\r\nHunt challenged Keats, \"then, and there, and to time,\" to write in\r\ncompetition with him a sonnet on _The Grasshopper and the Cricket_, and\r\nKeats finished his first. Passing a night there when he could not sleep,\r\nKeats wrote his _Sleep and Poetry_; and the cottage was rich, too, in\r\nrumours of such guests as Lamb, Hazlitt, and Coleridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEATS' HOUSE. HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nKeats was introduced to Coleridge by Leigh Hunt. In 1816, when he was\r\ntrying to cure himself of the opium habit, Coleridge went to live with Mr.\r\nGilman, a surgeon, in a house that still stands in The Grove, Highgate,\r\nand walking with Hunt one day in Millfield Lane, which runs on the\r\nHighgate side of the Heath, he chanced to meet Keats, and this is his own\r\naccount of the meeting: \"A loose, slack, and not well-dressed youth met me\r\nin a lane near Highgate. It was Keats. He was introduced to me, and stayed\r\na minute or so. After he had left us a little way, he ran back and said,\r\n'Let me carry away the memory, Coleridge, of having pressed your hand.'\r\n'There is death in that hand,' I said when Keats was gone; yet this was, I\r\nbelieve, before the consumption showed itself distinctly.\" But another\r\nfour years were not past when Hone, the author of _The Table Book_, saw\r\n\"poor Keats, the poet of _The Pot of Basil_, sitting and sobbing his dying\r\nbreath into a handkerchief,\" on a bench at the end of Well Walk,\r\noverlooking the Heath, \"glancing parting looks towards the quiet landscape\r\nhe had delighted in so much.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best descriptions of Keats in the last four years of his life\r\nare those given by Haydon, the painter, in his _Memoirs_, and by Leigh\r\nHunt in his _Autobiography_. \"He was below the middle size,\" according to\r\nHaydon, \"with a low forehead and an eye that had an inward look perfectly\r\ndivine, like a Delphian priestess who saw visions.... Unable to bear the\r\nsneers of ignorance or the attacks of envy, not having strength of mind\r\nenough to buckle himself together like a porcupine, and present nothing\r\nbut his prickles to his enemies, he began to despond, flew to dissipation\r\nas a relief which, after a temporary elevation of spirits, plunged him\r\ninto deeper despondency than ever. For six weeks he was scarcely sober,\r\nand to show what a man does to gratify his habits, when once they get the\r\nbetter of him, he once covered his tongue and throat as far as he could\r\nreach with cayenne pepper, in order to appreciate the 'delicious coldness\r\nof claret in all its glory'--his own expression.\" Leigh Hunt writes, \"He\r\nwas under the middle height; and his lower limbs were small in comparison\r\nwith the upper, but neat and well turned. His shoulders were very broad\r\nfor his size: he had a face in which energy and sensibility were\r\nremarkably mixed up; an eager power, checked and made patient by ill\r\nhealth. Every feature was at once strongly cut and delicately alive. If\r\nthere was any faulty expression, it was in the mouth, which was not\r\nwithout something of a character of pugnacity. His face was rather long\r\nthan otherwise; the upper lip projected a little over the under; the chin\r\nwas bold, the cheeks sunken; the eyes mellow and glowing, large, dark, and\r\nsensitive. At the recital of a noble action, or a beautiful thought, they\r\nwould suffuse with tears and his mouth trembled. In this there was ill\r\nhealth as well as imagination, for he did not like these betrayals of\r\nemotion; and he had great personal as well as moral courage. He once\r\nchastised a butcher, who had been insolent, by a regular stand-up fight.\"\r\n(Tradition says this fight took place in one of the narrow courts out of\r\nthe High Street, Hampstead.) \"His hair, of a brown colour, was fine, and\r\nhung in natural ringlets. The head was a puzzle for the phrenologists,\r\nbeing remarkably small in the skull; a singularity he had in common with\r\nByron and Shelley, whose hats I could not get on.\" Add to these a\r\ndescription given by one who knew him to Lord Houghton: \"His eyes were\r\nlarge and blue, his hair auburn; he wore it divided down the centre, and\r\nit fell in rich masses each side of his face; his mouth was full, and less\r\nintellectual than his other features. His countenance lives in my mind as\r\none of singular beauty and brightness; it had the expression as if it had\r\nbeen looking on some glorious sight.\"\r\n\r\nThe last two years of his life at Hampstead, with their quiet happiness,\r\nfierce unrests, passionate hopes and despairs, are all wonderfully\r\nreflected in his letters of this period. He writes from Wentworth Place to\r\nJohn Taylor, the publisher, in 1818, setting forth his poetical creed and\r\nsaying, with a clear perception of its defects, \"If _Endymion_ serves me\r\nas a pioneer, perhaps I ought to be content.... I have, I am sure, many\r\nfriends who, if I fail, will attribute any change in my life and temper to\r\nhumbleness rather than pride--to a cowering under the wings of great\r\npoets, rather than to a bitterness that I am not appreciated. I am anxious\r\nto get _Endymion_ printed that I may forget it and proceed.\" There is a\r\nlong letter to his sister in 1819, telling her of the books he has been\r\nreading, and describing his every-day life, beginning, \"The candles are\r\nburnt down and I am using the wax taper, which has a long snuff on it--the\r\nfire is at its last click--I am sitting with my back to it, with one foot\r\nrather askew upon the rug and the other with the heel a little elevated\r\nfrom the carpet. I am writing this on _The Maid's Tragedy_, which I have\r\nread since tea with great pleasure. Besides this volume of Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, there are on the table two volumes of Chaucer and a new work of\r\nTom Moore's called _Tom Cribb's Memorial to Congress_--nothing in it.\"\r\nReading this minute little sketch of himself, it is easy to picture him\r\nsitting late that night in his quiet room in Keats Grove; but it is the\r\nletters to Fanny Brawne that give this house, which was then two houses,\r\nits deepest and most living interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTABLE'S HOUSE. HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nIn 1819 he writes to her, whilst he is away holidaying in the Isle of\r\nWight and she at Wentworth Place, \"I have never known any unalloyed\r\nhappiness for many days together; the death or sickness of some one has\r\nalways spoilt my hours--and now, when none such troubles oppress me, it\r\nis, you must confess, very hard that another sort of pain should haunt me.\r\nAsk yourself, my love, whether you are not very cruel to have so\r\nentrammelled me, so destroyed my freedom.\" And again, \"Your letter gave me\r\nmore delight than anything in the world but yourself could do.... I never\r\nknew before what such love as you have made me feel was; I did not believe\r\nin it; my fancy was afraid of it, lest it should burn me up.\" And again,\r\n\"I have been in so irritable a state of health these two or three last\r\ndays, that I did not think I should be able to write this week.... I have\r\nbeen, I cannot tell why, in capital spirits this last hour. What reason?\r\nWhen I have to take my candle and retire to a lonely room, without the\r\nthought, as I fall asleep, of seeing you to-morrow morning? or the next\r\nday, or the next--it takes on the appearance of impossibility and\r\neternity. I will say a month--I will say I will see you in a month at\r\nmost, though no one but yourself should see me; if it be but for an hour.\r\nI should not like to be so near you as London without being continually\r\nwith you; after having once more kissed you, Sweet, I would rather be here\r\nalone at my task than in the bustle and hateful literary chitchat.\r\nMeantime you must write to me--as I will every week--for your letters keep\r\nme alive.\"\r\n\r\nBack in London, making a short stay with Leigh Hunt, then living at\r\nCollege Street, Kentish Town, Keats sends to Wentworth Place a letter to\r\nFanny Brawne, in the course of which he tells her, \"My love has made me\r\nselfish. I cannot exist without you. I am forgetful of everything but\r\nseeing you again--my Life seems to stop there--I see no further. You have\r\nabsorbed me.... My love is selfish. I cannot breathe without you.\" Even\r\nwhen he is home again, in his own part of the Wentworth Place house, he is\r\nwriting in February 1820, \"They say I must remain confined to this room\r\nfor some time. The consciousness that you love me will make a pleasant\r\nprison of the house next to yours. You must come and see me frequently:\r\nthis evening without fail\"; and again, in the same month, \"You will have a\r\npleasant walk to-day. I shall see you pass. I shall follow you with my\r\neyes over the Heath. Will you come towards evening instead of before\r\ndinner? When you are gone, 'tis past--if you do not come till the evening\r\nI have something to look forward to all day. Come round to my window for a\r\nmoment when you have read this.\"\r\n\r\nIn September of that year he set out on that voyage to Italy from which he\r\nwas never to return, and whilst the ship was delayed off the Isle of\r\nWight, he wrote to his friend, Charles Armitage Brown, at the old\r\nHampstead address, \"The very thing which I want to live most for will be a\r\ngreat occasion of my death. I cannot help it. Who can help it?... I\r\ndaresay you will be able to guess on what subject I am harping--you know\r\nwhat was my greatest pain during the first part of my illness at your\r\nhouse. I wish for death every day and night to deliver me from these\r\npains, and then I wish death away, for death would destroy even those\r\npains which are better than nothing.... I think, without my mentioning it,\r\nfor my sake, you would be a friend to Miss Brawne when I am dead. You\r\nthink she has many faults--but, for my sake, think she has not one. If\r\nthere is anything you can do for her by word or deed I know you will do\r\nit.... The thought of leaving Miss Brawne is beyond everything\r\nhorrible--the sense of darkness coming over me--I eternally see her figure\r\neternally vanishing. Some of the phrases she was in the habit of using\r\nduring my last nursing at Wentworth Place ring in my ears. Is there\r\nanother life? Shall I awake and find all this a dream? There must be; we\r\ncannot be created for this sort of suffering.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE DUMAURIER'S GRAVE. HAMPSTEAD.]\r\n\r\nBecause of all this, and of the reiterated longings and the heartaches\r\nthat Keats poured out in other letters that he wrote from Italy, and that\r\nwere delivered here to Armitage Brown, I always feel that Wentworth Place\r\nis the saddest and most sacred of London's literary shrines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nROUND ABOUT SOHO AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general thing the literary man is not to be found living in the\r\naristocratic quarters of the town until after he has done his best work\r\nand has begun to make money out of his inferior books. I don't think any\r\nman of letters has ever rented a house in Park Lane, except Disraeli, and\r\nhe went there as a successful politician; such glorious thoroughfares are\r\nreserved to more respectable stock-brokers and company-promoters, whilst\r\nthose whom the gods love are driven to seek refuge in the cheap and shabby\r\nhouses of meaner streets. Half the squalid squares and byways of Soho are\r\nin reality vestibules and aisles of the Temple of Fame. Blake, as we have\r\nseen in a former chapter, lived in Poland Street; and in the same street\r\nlived Flaxman, and, later, Shelley. Dryden lived in Gerrard Street, a\r\ncentury before Burke made his home there; Hazlitt died in Frith Street;\r\nMulready the painter had his studio in Broad Street; and the sculptor,\r\nJames Northcote, resided for over thirty years in Argyll Place. When\r\nMadame de Stael was in England she stayed at 30 (now 29) Argyll Street,\r\nand Byron speaks of visiting her there. I have already referred to Sir\r\nJames Thornhill's house in Dean Street; near by, in Soho Square, lived the\r\nactor, Kemble; and this square has pathetic memories of De Quincey, who\r\nlodged for a time, under strange circumstances, at the Greek Street corner\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nLeft an orphan to the care of guardians who seem to have treated him with\r\nsome harshness, De Quincey ran away from the Manchester Grammar School in\r\n1802, when he was only seventeen, and after wandering through Wales made\r\nhis way to London. Here for two months he was houseless, and seldom slept\r\nunder a roof, and for upwards of sixteen weeks suffered \"the physical\r\nanguish of hunger in various degrees of intensity.\" He tells you in his\r\n_Confessions_ how he used to pace \"the never-ending terraces\" of Oxford\r\nStreet, and at night sleep on some doorstep, and dream, \"and wake to the\r\ncaptivity of hunger.\" In Oxford Street he fell in with that most innocent\r\nand tender-hearted of street-walkers, Ann, whose surname he never knew,\r\nand to whose compassion and charity he always felt that he owed his life:\r\n\"For many weeks I had walked at nights with this poor friendless girl up\r\nand down Oxford Street, or had rested with her on steps and under the\r\nshelter of porticoes. She could not be so old as myself; she told me,\r\nindeed, that she had not completed her sixteenth year.... One night when\r\nwe were pacing slowly along Oxford Street, and after a day when I had felt\r\nmore than usually ill and faint, I requested her to turn off with me into\r\nSoho Square. Thither we went, and we sat down on the steps of a house\r\nwhich to this hour I never pass without a pang of grief and an inner act\r\nof homage to the spirit of that unhappy girl, in memory of the noble\r\naction which she there performed. Suddenly, as we sate, I grew much worse.\r\nI had been leaning my head against her bosom, and all at once I sank from\r\nher arms and fell backwards on the steps.\" He was so utterly exhausted\r\nthat he felt he must have died, but with a cry of terror she ran off into\r\nOxford Street and returned with port wine and spices which she had paid\r\nfor out of her own pocket, at a time when \"she had scarcely the\r\nwherewithal to purchase the bare necessaries of life;\" and this timely\r\nstimulant served to restore him.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, meeting a friend who lent him ten pounds, he travelled down to\r\nWindsor to see if he could get a certain friend of his family there to\r\nassist him; but before going he paid Ann something of his debt to her, and\r\narranged that three nights from then, and every night after until they\r\nshould meet, she would be at the corner of Titchfield Street, Soho. On his\r\nreturn to London he was at the appointed place night after night, but Ann\r\nnever appeared, and though he inquired everywhere and searched the\r\nneighbourhood for her he was never able to see or hear of her again.\r\n\r\nEarlier than this, however, and before he had succeeded in borrowing that\r\nten pounds, the coming on of a bitterly inclement winter drove him to seek\r\na wretched lodging at 61 (then 38) Greek Street, Soho Square. The house\r\nwas a dirty, neglected, cheerless place, tenanted by a disreputable\r\nattorney named Brunell-Brown, who had a curious clerk named Pyment, and\r\nonly came and went to and from his office by stealth because he was deep\r\nin debts and continually dodging the bailiffs. A few weeks of lodging\r\nmiserably here nearly exhausted the little cash De Quincey had brought to\r\nLondon with him, and he had to give up his room. But he explained his\r\nposition frankly to Brunell-Brown, and this kindly, reckless rascal, who\r\nhad a genuine knowledge and love of literature, and was interested in the\r\nyoung lodger who could talk to him intelligently on such matters, readily\r\ngave him permission to come to the house nightly and sleep gratis in one\r\nof its empty rooms, and allowed him, moreover, to eat the scraps from his\r\nbreakfast-table.\r\n\r\nThe house had an unoccupied look, especially of nights, when the lawyer\r\nhimself was usually absent. \"There was no household or establishment in\r\nit; nor any furniture, indeed, except a table and a few chairs. But I\r\nfound, on taking possession of my new quarters, that the house already\r\ncontained one single inmate, a poor friendless child, apparently ten years\r\nold; but she seemed hunger-bitten, and sufferings of that sort often make\r\nchildren look older than they are. From this forlorn child I learned that\r\nshe had lived and slept there for some time before I came; and great joy\r\nthe poor creature expressed when she found that I was in future to be her\r\ncompanion through the hours of darkness. The house was large, and from the\r\nwant of furniture the noise of the rats made a prodigious echoing on the\r\nspacious staircase and hall; and amidst the real fleshly ills of cold and,\r\nI fear, hunger, the forsaken child had found leisure to suffer still more\r\n(it appeared) from the self-created one of ghosts. I promised her\r\nprotection against all ghosts whatsoever, but, alas! I could offer her no\r\nother assistance. We lay upon the floor, with a bundle of cursed law\r\npapers for a pillow, but no other covering than a sort of large horseman's\r\ncloak; afterwards, however, we discovered in a garret an old sofa-cover, a\r\nsmall piece of rug, and some fragments of other articles, which added a\r\nlittle to our warmth. The poor child crept close to me for warmth and for\r\nsecurity against her ghostly enemies. When I was not more than usually ill\r\nI took her into my arms, so that in general she was tolerably warm, and\r\noften slept when I could not....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DE QUINCEY'S HOUSE. SOHO.]\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, the master of the house sometimes came in upon us suddenly, and\r\nvery early; sometimes not till ten o'clock; sometimes not at all. He was\r\nin constant fear of bailiffs. Improving on the plan of Cromwell, every\r\nnight he slept in a different quarter of London; and I observed that he\r\nnever failed to examine through a private window the appearance of those\r\nwho knocked at the door before he would allow it to be opened. He\r\nbreakfasted alone; indeed, his tea equipage would hardly have admitted of\r\nhis hazarding an invitation to a second person, any more than the quantity\r\nof esculent _mat\u00e9riel_, which for the most part was little more than a\r\nroll or a few biscuits which he had bought on his road from the place\r\nwhere he had slept. During his breakfast I generally contrived a reason\r\nfor lounging in, and with an air of as much indifference as I could\r\nassume, took up such fragments as he had left; sometimes, indeed, there\r\nwere none at all.... As to the poor child, she was never admitted into his\r\nstudy (if I may give that name to his chief depository of parchments, law\r\nwritings, &c.); that room was to her the Bluebeard room of the house,\r\nbeing regularly locked on his departure to dinner, about six o'clock,\r\nwhich usually was his final departure for the night. Whether the child\r\nwere an illegitimate daughter of Mr. Brunell-Brown, or only a servant, I\r\ncould not ascertain; she did not herself know; but certainly she was\r\ntreated altogether as a menial servant. No sooner did Mr. Brunell-Brown\r\nmake his appearance than she went below stairs, brushed his shoes, coat,\r\n&c.; and, except when she was summoned to run an errand, she never emerged\r\nfrom the dismal Tartarus of the kitchen, &c. to the upper air until my\r\nwelcome knock at night called up her little trembling footsteps to the\r\nfront door. Of her life during the daytime, however, I knew little but\r\nwhat I gathered from her own account at night, for as soon as the hours of\r\nbusiness commenced I saw that my absence would be acceptable, and in\r\ngeneral, therefore, I went off and sate in the parks or elsewhere until\r\nnightfall.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELLEY'S HOUSE. POLAND STREET W.]\r\n\r\nI have always thought that in all this there is something oddly\r\nreminiscent of Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness; the poor, half-starved\r\nlittle household drudge fits her part almost exactly, but De Quincey makes\r\nbut a depressed and dismal Dick Swiveller; and Mr. Brunell-Brown seems to\r\nhave been a lower type of the rascally lawyer than Sampson Brass was; but\r\nrascal as he was, one warms to him because of his kindness to his forlorn\r\nguest. \"I must forget everything but that towards me,\" says De Quincey,\r\n\"he was obliging and, to the extent of his power, generous.\" He goes on to\r\nsay that in after years, whenever he was in London, he never failed to\r\nvisit that house in Greek Street, and \"about ten o'clock this very night,\r\nAugust 15, 1821--being my birthday--I turned aside from my evening walk\r\ndown Oxford Street, purposely to take a glance at it; it is now occupied\r\nby a respectable family, and by the lights in the front drawing-room I\r\nobserved a domestic party assembled, perhaps at tea, and apparently\r\ncheerful and gay. Marvellous contrast, in my eyes, to the darkness,\r\ncold, silence and desolation of that same house eighteen years ago, when\r\nits nightly occupants were one famishing scholar and a neglected child.\r\nHer, by-the-by, in after years I vainly endeavoured to trace. Apart from\r\nher situation, she was not what would be called an interesting child; she\r\nwas neither pretty nor quick in understanding, nor remarkably pleasing in\r\nmanners.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS DE QUINCEY]\r\n\r\nHis London privations ended with a reconciliation between himself and his\r\nguardians, and he was sent to Oxford--his quarrel with them being that\r\nthey would not allow him to go there.\r\n\r\nDe Quincey quitted Soho to go to Oxford, and Shelley, when he was expelled\r\nfrom Oxford in 1811, came to Soho. He travelled up to London on the coach\r\nwith his friend Hogg. His cousin and sometime schoolfellow, Medwin,\r\nrelates how before dawn on a March morning Shelley and Hogg knocked at his\r\ndoor in Garden Court, Temple, and he heard Shelley's cracked voice cry, in\r\nhis well-known pipe, \"Medwin, let me in. I am expelled,\" and after a loud\r\nsort of half-hysterical laugh repeat, \"I am expelled,\" and add \"for\r\natheism.\" After breakfast they went out to look for lodgings, and, says\r\nHogg, \"never was a young beauty so capricious, so hard to please\" as\r\nShelley; but the name of Poland Street attracted him because it suggested\r\nrecollections of Thaddeus of Warsaw and freedom, and he declared \"we must\r\nlodge here, should we sleep on the step of a door.\" A bill advertising\r\nlodgings to let hung in the window of No. 15, so they knocked and entered\r\nand inspected them--\"a quiet sitting-room, its walls papered with\r\ntrellised vine-leaves and clustering grapes,\" with a similarly decorated\r\nbedroom opening out of it, and Shelley whispered, \"We must stay here for\r\never.\"\r\n\r\n\"For ever\" dwindled to something less than a year; but here for that time\r\nShelley lived and resumed his interrupted studies, as far as might be, and\r\nwas secretly supported by his sisters, who sent their pocket-money round\r\nto him by the hand of their schoolfellow, Harriett Westbrook, daughter of\r\nthe retired tavern-keeper, John Westbrook, who was living near Park Lane,\r\nat 23 Chapel Street (now Aldford Street).\r\n\r\nIn April 1811 Shelley's father wrote insisting that he should break off\r\nall relations with Hogg and place himself under a tutor of his father's\r\nselection, and Shelley replied, from his Poland Street lodgings:--\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR FATHER,--As you do me the honour of requesting to hear the\r\n    determination of my mind, as the basis of your future actions, I feel\r\n    it my duty, although it gives me pain to wound 'the sense of duty to\r\n    your own character, to that of your family, and feelings as a\r\n    Christian,' decidedly to refuse my assent to both the proposals in\r\n    your letter, and to affirm that similar refusals will always be the\r\n    fate of similar requests. With many thanks for your great kindness,--I\r\n    remain your affectionate, dutiful son,\r\n\r\n      \"PERCY B. SHELLEY.\"\r\n\r\nHis father presently relented so far as to make him an allowance of two\r\nhundred pounds a year. One evening in August, having arranged a hasty\r\nelopement with Harriett Westbrook, Shelley walked from Poland Street to a\r\nsmall coffee-house in Mount Street, and as Dr. Dowden sets forth in his\r\nLife of the poet, dispatched a letter thence to Harriett, her father's\r\nhouse in Aldford Street being close handy, telling her at what hour he\r\nwould have a hackney coach waiting for her at the door of the\r\ncoffee-house. At the appointed time the coach was there in readiness, and\r\na little behind time \"Harriett was seen tripping round the corner from\r\nChapel Street, and the coach wheels rattled towards the City inn from\r\nwhich the northern mails departed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELLEY. MARCHMONT STREET.]\r\n\r\nThey travelled post-haste to the North, and were married in Edinburgh; and\r\nin another three years the deserted Harriett had ended her life in the\r\nSerpentine, and Shelley had gone off with Mary Godwin. Meanwhile, however,\r\nreturning to London after his marriage to Harriett, Shelley stayed for a\r\nfew days at the house of his father-in-law, and then at Cooke's Hotel, in\r\nAlbemarle Street. On another occasion he lodged for a short time at a\r\nhouse still standing in Marchmont Street (No. 26), a drab and dingy\r\nthoroughfare in the neighbourhood of Russell Square.\r\n\r\nHazlitt was a Soho resident for no longer than about six months. In 1830\r\nhe came from his lodgings in Bouverie Street to occupy rooms at No. 6\r\nFrith Street. He was then already failing in health, separated from his\r\nwife, harassed financially through the failure of his publishers,\r\naltogether broken and dispirited. Much disappointment, the thwarting of\r\nmany of his highest personal ambitions, had soured and embittered him.\r\nHaydon calls him a \"singular mixture of friend and fiend, radical and\r\ncritic, metaphysician, poet and painter, on whose word no one could rely,\r\non whose heart no one could calculate.\" A critic of genius, a brilliant\r\nessayist; with not so great a heart as Lamb's but a finer intellect; he\r\nhas never to this day received his full meed of recognition. He moves in\r\nspirit among the immortals as apart and unsociable as he moved among them\r\nin the body. \"We are told,\" wrote P. G. Patmore, \"that on the summit of\r\none of those columns which form the magnificent ruins of Hadrian's Temple,\r\nin the plain of Athens, there used to dwell a hermit who scarcely ever\r\ndescended from this strangely-chosen abode, owing his scanty food and\r\nsupport to the mingled admiration and curiosity of the peasants who\r\ninhabited the plain below. Something like this was the position of William\r\nHazlitt. Self-banished from the social world, no less by the violence of\r\nhis own passions than by those petty regards of custom and society which\r\ncould not or would not tolerate the trifling aberrations from external\r\nform and usage engendered by a mind like his, ... he became, as regarded\r\nhimself, personally heedless of all things but the immediate gratification\r\nof his momentary wishes, careless of personal character, indifferent to\r\nliterary fame, forgetful of the past, reckless of the future, and yet so\r\nexquisitely alive to the claims and the virtues of all these that the\r\nabandonment of his birthright in every one of them opened a separate\r\ncanker in his heart, and made his life a living emblem of the early death\r\nwhich it foretokened.\"\r\n\r\nPatmore, too, has given a good sketch of his personal appearance. \"The\r\nforehead,\" he says, \"was magnificent; the nose precisely that which\r\nphysiognomists have assigned as evidence of a fine and highly cultivated\r\ntaste; though there was a peculiar character about the nostrils like\r\nthat observable in those of a fiery and unruly horse. His eyes were not\r\ngood. They were never brilliant, and there was a furtive and at times a\r\nsinister look about them as they glanced suspiciously from under their\r\noverhanging brows.\" Other contemporaries have described him as a grave\r\nman, diffident, almost awkward in manner, of middle size, and with eager,\r\nexpressive eyes. S. C. Hall considered him mean-looking and\r\nunprepossessing; but though Talfourd speaks of him as slouching, awkward,\r\nand neglectful in his dress, he credits him with \"a handsome, eager\r\ncountenance, worn by sickness and thought.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAZLITT'S HOUSE. FRITH STREET.]\r\n\r\nBut he was nearing the end of it all when he came to Frith Street. In\r\nAugust he was attacked with a violent sort of cholera, and never rallied\r\nfrom it. What was probably his last essay, one on \"The Sick Chamber,\"\r\nappeared that same month in the _New Monthly_, picturing his own invalid\r\ncondition and touching gratefully on the consolation and enjoyment he\r\ncould still derive from books. Nearing the close, he begged that his\r\nmother might be sent for, but she was an old lady of eighty-four living in\r\nDevonshire and was unable to go to him. \"He died so quietly,\" in the words\r\nof his grandson, \"that his son, who was sitting by his bedside, did not\r\nknow that he was gone till the vital breath had been extinct a moment or\r\ntwo. His last words were, 'Well, I've had a happy life.'\" The same\r\nauthority adds that he found the following memorandum, in the handwriting\r\nof his grandmother: \"Saturday, 18th September 1830, at about half-past\r\nfour in the afternoon, died at his lodgings, No. 6 Frith Street, Soho,\r\nWilliam Hazlitt, aged fifty-two years five months and eight days. Mr.\r\nLamb, Mr. White, Mr. Hersey, and his own son were with him at the time.\"\r\n\r\nHe was buried within a minute's walk of his house, in the churchyard of\r\nSt. Anne's, Soho, and his tombstone removed from its first position,\r\nstands back against the wall of the church: the stone originally bore a\r\ncurious, somewhat militant inscription, but this has recently been\r\nobliterated, and replaced by one that offers nothing but his name and a\r\nrecord of the dates of his birth and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA PHILOSOPHER, TWO POETS, AND A NOVELIST\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody has heard of _Sandford and Merton_, and hardly anybody nowadays\r\nhas read it. I confess with shame that I am one who has not. But I have\r\ncome across so many parodies of it and so many references to it in various\r\nbooks and articles that I am finding it more and more difficult to believe\r\nthat I have not actually read the story itself. Mr. Barlow, the boy's\r\ntutor, lives in my mind as a large and solemn bore, but he was a bore of\r\nreal knowledge; he was heavy with learning; and the boys themselves were\r\ndreadful little prigs, but underneath their priggishness they were manly\r\nboys, and there was something fine in their ideals of honour. No doubt\r\nthey were largely modelled on their author, Thomas Day, who when he was a\r\nschoolboy started a fight with another boy on quite justifiable grounds,\r\nand soon finding that he completely outmatched his opponent, stopped the\r\nfight, and insisted on shaking hands with the other and making peace.\r\n\r\nThat incident, and the queer originality of his whole outlook on life, has\r\nmade me more interested in Day himself than in his one famous book, and\r\nhas made me number 36 Wellclose Square, the house where he was born,\r\namong the London literary shrines that must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nWellclose Square is in Shadwell, on the skirts of Whitechapel, and is one\r\nof those melancholy places that have obviously seen better days. Dreary\r\nand drab and squalid as you see it now, when Day was born there on the\r\n22nd June 1748 it must have been a fairly select and superior residential\r\nquarter. Day's father was a collector of Customs who died a year after his\r\nson's birth, leaving him a very comfortable fortune of twelve hundred a\r\nyear. The boy was educated at Charterhouse and at Oxford, and one way and\r\nanother acquired lofty Stoic principles and a somewhat original philosophy\r\nthat he lived up to obstinately all his life through, in spite of many\r\nrebuffs and a good deal of ridicule. He dressed carelessly, was\r\nindifferent to appearances, and scorned the \"admiration of splendour which\r\ndazzles and enslaves mankind.\" He preferred the society of his inferiors\r\nbecause they were more unconventional, less artificial than the ladies and\r\ngentlemen of his own rank; he was awkward in the company of women, and\r\nregarded the sex with doubt as well as with diffidence. As you would\r\nexpect of the man who wrote _Sandford and Merton_, he had no sense of\r\nhumour; and his smallpox-pitted face and unattractive air and manner told\r\nso much against him that he was rejected emphatically by the first one or\r\ntwo women he proposed to. Withal, as was also fitting in the author of\r\nthat fearsomely moral schoolboy-book, he was, in the words of his friend\r\nEdgeworth, \"the most virtuous human being I have ever known.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS DAY. 36 WELLCLOSE SQUARE.]\r\n\r\nI suppose he was a pioneer of the \"simple life\" theory; anyhow, he\r\npersistently advocated simplicity in dress and living, and was determined\r\nto find a wife who shared these tastes, who should, moreover, be fond of\r\nliterature and moral philosophy, \"simple as a mountain girl in her dress,\r\ndiet, and manners, and fearless and intrepid as the Spartan wives and\r\nRoman heroines.\" He was careful to state these requirements to the lady\r\nbefore proposing to her, and this seems to have spoilt his chances. The\r\ndifficulty of discovering his ideal wife led to his making an odd\r\nexperiment. He adopted two young girls, one from the Foundling Hospital,\r\nthe other from the Shrewsbury Orphanage, and in deference to the\r\nproprieties formally bound them apprentice to his friend Edgeworth, and\r\ngave guarantees to the authorities that within one year he would make a\r\ndecision between the two and pay a premium of a hundred pounds to\r\napprentice one to a suitable trade, and send the other to be properly\r\neducated with the ultimate object of marrying her. The girls were about\r\ntwelve years old. In order that they should not be influenced with wrong\r\nideas by the people about them, he took them into France, where, as they\r\nonly understood English, they could talk with nobody but himself; and\r\nthere he proceeded to teach them reading and writing, and by ridicule,\r\nexplanation, and reasoning sought \"to imbue them with a deep hatred for\r\ndress, for luxury, for fine people, for fashion and titles, all of which\r\ninspired his own mind with such an unconquerable horror.\" In a letter\r\nwhich he wrote home about them he says, \"I am not disappointed in one\r\nrespect. I am more attached to and more convinced of the truth of my\r\nprinciples than ever. I have made them, in respect of temper, two such\r\ngirls as, I may perhaps say without vanity, you have never seen at the\r\nsame age. They have never given me a moment's trouble throughout the\r\nvoyage, are always contented, and think nothing so agreeable as waiting\r\nupon me (no moderate convenience for a lazy man).\" Nevertheless, in\r\nFrance, the girls proved very quarrelsome; he had to nurse them through a\r\nsevere attack of smallpox, and once when they were out boating they both\r\nfell into the Rhone, and he risked his life to save them.\r\n\r\nWithin the year, he brought them back to England and had made his choice.\r\nHe apprenticed one, who was \"invincibly stupid,\" to a milliner; and the\r\nother, Sabrina Sidney, he carried with him to a house he had taken near\r\nLichfield and there \"resumed his preparations for implanting in her young\r\nmind the characteristic virtues of Arria, Portia and Cornelia.\" But she\r\ndisappointed him; he endeavoured in vain to steel her against shrinking\r\nfrom pain and the fear of danger. \"When he dropped melting sealing-wax on\r\nher arms she did not endure it heroically; nor when he fired pistols at\r\nher petticoats which she believed to be charged with balls could she help\r\nstarting aside or suppress her screams.\" She was not fond of science, and\r\nwas unable to keep a secret satisfactorily; so after a year's trial Day\r\nsent her away to a boarding-school, and proceeded to pay his addresses to\r\na young lady living in the neighbourhood, who first put him on a period of\r\nprobation, and then, after he had made himself ridiculous in trying to\r\ndress and behave as she wished, rejected him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD BYRON]\r\n\r\nWhereupon his thoughts turned again to Sabrina, who had a real affection\r\nfor him; but her failure to obey him in certain small details of dress\r\nagain displeased him, and finally deciding against her, he in the long run\r\nmarried a Miss Milnes. His one objection to this lady was that she\r\npossessed a considerable fortune, and would therefore probably refuse to\r\nlive the simple life; but when he had categorically put his requirements\r\nto her, and she had consented to dispense with all luxuries, to cut\r\nherself off from social gaieties, and reside in the country with him,\r\nrestricted in every way to the bare necessaries of existence, working and\r\nspending for the behoof of the poor and needy, he ventured to make her\r\nMrs. Day, and never had occasion to regret it. Sabrina eventually married\r\na barrister, but refused to do so until she had Day's consent; and when,\r\nafter writing divers political, economic, and philosophical works that\r\nnobody hears of now, and _Sandford and Merton_, which nobody reads any\r\nlonger, Day died of a fall from an unmanageable horse which he insisted\r\ncould be controlled by kindness, his wife was inconsolable, and died soon\r\nafter him of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nSo he must have been a man worth knowing, and, in spite of his\r\npeculiarities and his oppressive earnestness, more likeable than most of\r\nus, when you knew him. Anyhow, he thought for himself, and had opinions of\r\nhis own, and was not afraid to act upon them. And such men are so\r\nuncommonly rare that I think the County Council should put a tablet on the\r\nface of his birthplace at once, for the encouragement of all men who are\r\nsomething more than cheap copies of their neighbours.\r\n\r\nAcross the other side of London, at 24 (then 16) Holles Street, Cavendish\r\nSquare, Lord Byron was born, on 22nd January 1788--a very different man,\r\nbut also unconventional, though in more conventional ways. But the house\r\nhere has been considerably altered to suit the requirements of the big\r\ndrapery establishment that at present occupies it, and of Byron's various\r\nresidences in London I believe the only one that survives in its original\r\ncondition is that at No. 4 Bennet Street, St. James's. Here he had rooms\r\non the first floor in 1813 and the early months of 1814, and it was in\r\nthose rooms that he wrote _The Giaour_, _The Bride of Abydos_, and _The\r\nCorsair_. Writing to Moore from here on the 28th July 1813, he says, \"I am\r\ntraining to dine with Sheridan and Rogers this evening\"; and in the Diary\r\nhe was keeping at this time he notes, on 16th November 1813, \"Read Burns\r\nto-day. What would he have been, if a patrician? We should have had more\r\npolish--less force--just as much verse but no immortality--a divorce and\r\nduel or two, the which had he survived, as his potations must have been\r\nless spirituous, he might have lived as long as Sheridan, and outlived as\r\nmuch as poor Brinsley.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Bennet Street Byron carried on a correspondence with the lady he was\r\ndestined to marry, Miss Anna Isabella Milbanke. \"I look upon myself,\" he\r\ntells her in one of his letters, \"as a very facetious personage, and may\r\nappeal to most of my acquaintance in proof of my assertion. Nobody laughs\r\nmore, and though your friend Joanna Baillie says somewhere that 'Laughter\r\nis the child of misery,' I do not believe her (unless indeed a hysteric),\r\nthough I think it is sometimes the parent.\" In another of the same\r\nSeptember 1813, evidently replying to one of hers, he protests: \"'Gay'\r\nbut not 'content'--very true.... You have detected a laughter 'false to\r\nthe heart'--allowed--yet I have been tolerably sincere with you, and I\r\nfear sometimes troublesome.\" In November he writes to her, \"I perceive by\r\npart of your last letter that you are still inclined to believe me a\r\ngloomy personage. Those who pass so much of their time entirely alone\r\ncan't be always in very high spirits; yet I don't know--though I certainly\r\ndo enjoy society to a certain extent, I never passed two hours in mixed\r\ncompany without wishing myself out of it again. Still, I look upon myself\r\nas a facetious companion, well reputed by all the wits at whose jests I\r\nreadily laugh, and whose repartees I take care never to incur by any kind\r\nof contest--for which I feel as little qualified as I do for the more\r\nsolid pursuits of demonstration.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BYRON. 4 BENNET STREET. ST. JAMES'S.]\r\n\r\nAs for his gloom or gaiety, Sir Walter Scott, who lunched with him and\r\nCharles Mathews at Long's Hotel, in Old Bond Street, in 1815, said, \"I\r\nnever saw Byron so full of fun, frolic, wit, and whim: he was as playful\r\nas a kitten.\" Again, writing in his Journal, after Byron's death, Sir\r\nWalter observes, \"What I liked about Byron, besides his boundless genius,\r\nwas his generosity of spirit as well as purse, and his utter contempt of\r\nall affectations of literature, from the school-magisterial style to the\r\nlackadaisical\"; and he relates an anecdote in illustration of Byron's\r\nextreme sensitiveness: \"Like Rousseau, he was apt to be very suspicious,\r\nand a plain, downright steadiness of manner was the true mode to maintain\r\nhis good opinion. Will Rose told me that once, while sitting with Byron,\r\nhe fixed insensibly his eyes on his feet, one of which, it must be\r\nremembered, was deformed. Looking up suddenly, he saw Byron regarding him\r\nwith a look of concentrated and deep displeasure, which wore off when he\r\nobserved no consciousness or embarrassment in the countenance of Rose.\r\nMurray afterwards explained this by telling Rose that Lord Byron was very\r\njealous of having this personal imperfection noticed or attended to.\" He\r\ngoes on to say that Byron was a mischief-maker; he would tell one man the\r\nunpleasant things that had been privately said of him by another; and he\r\nloved to mystify people, \"to be thought awful, mysterious and gloomy, and\r\nsometimes hinted at strange causes.\"\r\n\r\nSo that if he had no literary affectations he clearly cultivated a pose of\r\nmysterious misery both in his life and his poetry, and this it was that\r\nexasperated Carlyle into calling him \"the teeth-grinding, glass-eyed, lone\r\nCaloyer.\" And the pose was helped out by his handsome and romantic\r\nappearance. \"Byron's countenance is a thing to dream of,\" Scott told\r\nLockhart. \"A certain fair lady whose name has been too often mentioned in\r\nconnection with his told a friend of mine that when she first saw Byron it\r\nwas in a crowded room, and she did not know who it was, but her eyes were\r\ninstantly nailed, and she said to herself, 'That pale face is my fate.'\r\nAnd, poor soul, if a god-like face and god-like powers could have made\r\nexcuse for devilry, to be sure she had one.\" He said on the same occasion,\r\n\"As for poets, I have seen, I believe, all the best of our own time and\r\ncountry--and, though Burns had the most glorious eyes imaginable, I never\r\nthought any of them would come up to an artist's notion of the character\r\nexcept Byron.\" Mrs. Opie said, \"His voice was such a voice as the devil\r\ntempted Eve with\"; and Charles Mathews once remarked that \"he was the only\r\nman I ever contemplated to whom I felt disposed to apply the word\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for a while Miss Milbanke was proof against his\r\nfascinations. In November 1813, about the date of that last letter of his\r\nto her from which I have quoted, he offered her his hand and was rejected.\r\nHe proposed to another lady in the following September, and was rejected\r\nagain, and almost immediately afterwards he called on Miss Milbanke at her\r\nfather's house, 29 Portland Place, and in the library there passionately\r\nrenewed his suit, and this time was successful. They were married in\r\nJanuary 1815, and went to live at 13 Piccadilly, and in January of the\r\nnext year, after twelve months of little happiness and much wretchedness,\r\nseparated for good, a month after the birth of their child.\r\n\r\nThis Piccadilly house has been pulled down. The Albany to which Byron\r\nremoved in 1814, and which he left on his marriage, still remains; and so,\r\ntoo, does No. 8 St. James's Street, where he lived in 1809, when his\r\n_English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_ took the town by storm, but it has\r\nundergone so much alteration that it no longer seems so intimately\r\nreminiscent of Byron as Bennet Street does.\r\n\r\nWhilst Byron was residing in St. James's Street, publishing the _English\r\nBards_ and writing the first canto of _Childe Harold_, Coleridge was\r\nliving in a house at Portland Place, Hammersmith, that is now known as No.\r\n7 Addison Bridge Place. Somehow, one does not readily connect Coleridge\r\nwith London, even though he had lodged for many years at Highgate before\r\nhe died there. But one time and another he spent quite a large part of his\r\nlife in the metropolis. He was at school with Lamb, of course, at Christ's\r\nHospital; and are not Lamb's letters strewn with yearning remembrances of\r\nthe glorious evenings he and Coleridge and Hazlitt and others passed, in\r\nlater years, in the smoky parlour of \"The Salutation and Cat,\" in Newgate\r\nStreet? At various dates, he lived at Buckingham Street, and at Norfolk\r\nStreet, Strand, in Pall Mall, and in King Street, Covent Garden, when he\r\nwas working on the staff of the _Morning Post_; to say nothing of visits\r\nto London when he put up at one or another of Lamb's many homes in the\r\nCity; and there is still in one of the courts of Fetter Lane that Newton\r\nHall where he delivered a series of lectures in 1818.\r\n\r\nBy 1810, when he came to London and settled for a period at 7 Addison\r\nBridge Place, Coleridge had done all his great work as a poet, and under\r\nstress of financial difficulties was turning more and more from poetry to\r\nlecturing and journalism as sources of income. There is a letter of Lamb's\r\nto Hazlitt, dated 28th November 1810, when Hazlitt was holidaying and\r\nworking at Winterslow, in which he mentions towards the close--\"Coleridge\r\nis in town, or at least at Hammersmith. He is writing or going to write in\r\nthe _Courier_ against Cobbett and in favour of paper money.\" Byron wrote\r\nto a friend in the succeeding year, \"Coleridge is lecturing. 'Many an old\r\nfool,' said Hannibal to some such lecturer, 'but such as this, never'\";\r\nand to the same friend two days later, \"Coleridge has been lecturing\r\nagainst Campbell. Rogers was present, and from him I derive the\r\ninformation. We are going to make a party to hear this Manichean of\r\npoesy\"; and on the same day to another friend, \"Coleridge has attacked the\r\n_Pleasures of Hope_, and all other pleasures whatsoever. Mr. Rogers was\r\npresent, and heard himself indirectly _rowed_ by the lecturer\"; and next\r\nweek, \"To-morrow I dine with Rogers, and am to hear Coleridge, who is a\r\nkind of rage at present.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLERIDGE. ADDISON BRIDGE PLACE.]\r\n\r\nColeridge was then only thirty-eight, and had another twenty-four years of\r\nlife before him. He was already, and had for long past, been struggling in\r\nthe toils of the opium habit, and his poetical inspiration was leaving\r\nhim, for though _Christabel_ and _Kubla Khan_ were not published until\r\n1816 they were written nearly ten years before. There are a number of\r\nminor poems bearing later dates; several in 1809, many long after that,\r\nbut only one dated 1810, which may be supposed to have been written in\r\nthat Hammersmith house, and this is nothing but a respectable translation\r\nof a passage in Ottfried's metrical paraphrase of the Gospels. But his\r\nlectures were a wonder and a delight, Byron's disapproval notwithstanding.\r\nHe was always an eloquent preacher, and became a chief among lecturers as\r\nhe did among poets. \"Have you ever heard me preach?\" he asked Lamb, and\r\nLamb replied with his whimsical stammer, \"I never heard you do anything\r\nelse!\" But you remember that fine essay of Hazlitt's in which he recounts\r\nhis first acquaintance with Coleridge?--how he rose before daylight and\r\nwalked ten miles in the mud to hear him preach. \"When I got there, the\r\norgan was playing the hundredth psalm, and when it was done Mr. Coleridge\r\nrose and gave out his text, 'And he went up into the mountain to pray,\r\nHIMSELF, ALONE.' As he gave out his text his voice 'rose like a steam of\r\nrich distilled perfumes,' and when he came to the two last words, which he\r\npronounced loud, deep, and distinct, it seemed to me, who was then young,\r\nas if the sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart, and as if\r\nthat prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the universe.\" He\r\ndescribes the sermon, and goes on, \"I could not have been more delighted\r\nif I had heard the music of the spheres. Poetry and Philosophy had met\r\ntogether.... I returned home well satisfied.\" Then Coleridge called to see\r\nhis father, a dissenting minister in the neighbourhood, and for two hours\r\nhe talked and Hazlitt listened spellbound, and when he went, Hazlitt\r\nwalked with him six miles on the road. \"It was a fine morning,\" he says,\r\n\"in the middle of winter, and he talked the whole way.\" And with what a\r\nfine generosity he acknowledges what that meeting and this talk of\r\nColeridge's had meant to him. \"I was stunned, startled with it as from a\r\ndeep sleep.... I was at that time dumb, inarticulate, helpless, like a\r\nworm by the wayside, crushed, bleeding, lifeless; but now, bursting the\r\ndeadly bands that bound them--\r\n\r\n  'With Styx nine times round them,'\r\n\r\nmy ideas float on winged words, and as they expand their plumes catch the\r\ngolden light of other years. My soul has indeed remained in its original\r\nbondage, dark, obscure, with longings infinite and unsatisfied; my heart,\r\nshut up in the prison-house of this rude clay, has never found nor will it\r\never find a heart to speak to; but that my understanding also did not\r\nremain dumb and brutish, or at length found a language to express itself,\r\nI owe to Coleridge.\" That was when Coleridge was twenty-six and Hazlitt\r\ntwenty. These twelve years after that, when Coleridge was lecturing in\r\nLondon, his fancy and imagination were as dazzling and as powerful as\r\never, and his voice and language had lost none of their magic. But his\r\nthoughts were perhaps tending towards that transcendental obscurity that\r\nreached its worst when he was established in his closing days at Highgate,\r\nwith his little group of worshipping disciples around him, and when\r\nCarlyle went to hear and to ridicule him. Anyhow, here is an account\r\nRogers gives of a visit he paid to him when he had transferred himself\r\nfrom Hammersmith to Pall Mall:--\r\n\r\n\"Coleridge was a marvellous talker. One morning when Hookham Frere also\r\nbreakfasted with me, Coleridge talked for three hours without\r\nintermission, about poetry, and so admirably that I wish every word he\r\nuttered had been written down. But sometimes his harangues were quite\r\nunintelligible, not only to myself, but to others. Wordsworth and I called\r\nupon him one afternoon, when he was in a lodging off Pall Mall. He talked\r\nuninterruptedly for about two hours, during which Wordsworth listened to\r\nhim with profound attention, every now and then nodding his head, as if in\r\nassent. On quitting the lodgings I said to Wordsworth, 'Well, for my part,\r\nI could not make head or tail of Coleridge's oration; pray did you\r\nunderstand it?' 'Not one syllable of it,' was Wordsworth's reply.\"\r\n\r\nHe talked like one inspired, but his looks, except whilst he was talking,\r\nbelied him. \"My face,\" he said justly of himself, \"unless when animated by\r\nimmediate eloquence, expresses great sloth and great, indeed almost\r\nidiotic, good nature. 'Tis a mere carcase of a face, flat, flabby, and\r\nexpressive chiefly of unexpression. Yet I am told that my eye, eyebrows,\r\nand forehead are physiognomically good.\" De Quincey says there was a\r\npeculiar haze or dimness mixed with the light of his eyes; and when he was\r\nroused to animation Lamb thought he looked like \"an archangel a little\r\ndamaged.\" But whether that haze of his eyes got into his talk, whether his\r\nthoughts were obscurely uttered, or whether it was they were too high and\r\ngreat for his auditors to take in so easily as a listener expects to grasp\r\nwhat is said to him is, at least, an open question. It may well be that\r\nShelley hit the truth in the _Letter to Maria Gisborne_ that he wrote from\r\nLeghorn, in 1820:--\r\n\r\n  \"You will see Coleridge; he who sits obscure\r\n   In the exceeding lustre and the pure\r\n   Intense irradiation of a mind\r\n   Which, with its own internal lightnings blind,\r\n   Flags wearily through darkness and despair--\r\n   A cloud-encircled meteor of the air,\r\n   A hooded eagle among blinking owls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCHARLES LAMB\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one of those free-and-easy sociable gatherings in Lamb's rooms, in the\r\nTemple, which Hazlitt has so happily immortalised, Lamb provoked some\r\ndiscussion by asking which of all the English literary men of the past one\r\nwould most wish to have seen and known. Ayrton, who was of the company,\r\nsaid he would choose the two greatest names in English literature--Sir\r\nIsaac Newton and John Locke. \"Every one burst out laughing,\" writes\r\nHazlitt, \"at the expression of Lamb's face, in which impatience was\r\nrestrained by courtesy. 'Yes, the greatest names,' he stammered out\r\nhastily, 'but they were not persons--not persons.... There is nothing\r\npersonally interesting in the men.'\" It is Lamb's glory that he is both a\r\ngreat name and a great and interesting personality; and if his question\r\nwere put again to-day in any company of book-lovers I should not be alone\r\nin saying at once that the writer of the past I would soonest have seen\r\nand known is Charles Lamb.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to write of him without letting your enthusiasm run away\r\nwith you. Except for a few reviewers of his own day (and the reviewers of\r\none's own day count for little or nothing the day after), nobody who knew\r\nLamb in his life or has come to know him through his books and the books\r\nthat tell of him has been able to write of him except with warmest\r\nadmiration and affection. Even so testy and difficult a man as Landor, who\r\nonly saw Lamb once, could not touch on his memory without profound\r\nemotion, and says in some memorial verses:--\r\n\r\n  \"Of all that ever wore man's form, 'tis thee\r\n   I first would spring to at the gates of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you remember Wordsworth's--\r\n\r\n  \"O, he was good, if e'er a good man lived!\"\r\n\r\nThere is, too, that well-known anecdote of how Thackeray lifted a volume\r\nof _Elia_ and held it against his forehead and murmured \"St. Charles!\" All\r\nwhich, and many other utterances of love and reverence for his personal\r\ncharacter, particularly Wordsworth's reference to him as \"Lamb, the frolic\r\nand the gentle,\" would have exasperated Lamb himself and moved him to\r\nangry protest. \"I have had the _Anthology_,\" he wrote to Coleridge in\r\n1800, \"and like only one thing in it, 'Lewti'; but of that the last stanza\r\nis detestable, the rest most exquisite: the epithet 'enviable' would dash\r\nthe finest poem. For God's sake (I never was more serious) don't make me\r\nridiculous any more by terming me gentle-hearted in print, or do it in\r\nbetter verses. It did well enough five years ago when I came to see you,\r\nand was moral coxcomb enough at the time you wrote the lines to feed upon\r\nsuch epithets; but besides that the meaning of 'gentle' is equivocal at\r\nbest, and almost always means poor-spirited, the very quality of\r\ngentleness is abhorrent to such vile trumpetings. My sentiment has long\r\nsince vanished. I hope my virtues have done sucking. I can scarce think\r\nbut you meant it in joke. I hope you did, for I should be ashamed to\r\nbelieve that you could think to gratify me by such praise, fit only to be\r\na cordial to some green-sick sonneteer.\" The epithet so rankled in his\r\nrecollection that a week later he returned to the topic. \"In the next\r\nedition of the _Anthology_ (which Phoebus avert, and those nine other\r\nwandering maids also!) please to blot out 'gentle-hearted,' and substitute\r\n'drunken dog, ragged head, seld-shaven, odd-eyed, stuttering,' or any\r\nother epithet which truly and properly belongs to the gentleman in\r\nquestion. And for Charles read Tom, or Bob, or Richard for mere delicacy.\"\r\n\r\nGentle Lamb certainly was, but the word is not large enough or robustly\r\nhuman enough to cover all his character. He wins your regard by his faults\r\nas well as by his virtues. If he drank a little too much at times, and\r\nsometimes talked and wrote foolishly and too flippantly to please the\r\nserious-minded, he far more often talked and wrote wisely, wittily,\r\nexquisitely, and for thirty-eight years of his life he readily sacrificed\r\nhimself to his sister's well-being, giving up all thought of marriage that\r\nhe might be her constant guardian and attendant, watching dreadfully for\r\nsigns of her recurring fits of insanity, and when they were coming upon\r\nher going with her to the melancholy gate of the asylum, and directly her\r\nmind was cleared, returning eagerly to fetch her home again.\r\n\r\nHe was never in the habit of laying himself out to create a good\r\nimpression on strangers; if they were unsympathetic, or he did not take to\r\nthem, in his freakish fashion he would deliberately say and do things to\r\nshock and antagonise them, and so it came about that those who did not\r\nknow him or could not appreciate him frequently set him down as \"something\r\nbetween an imbecile, a brute, and a buffoon.\" Carlyle formed that sort of\r\nimpression of him; and one can believe there was scarcely any point of\r\ncontact between Carlyle's sombre, deadly earnest, man-with-a-message\r\noutlook and the tricksy, elvish, quaintly humorous spirit of Lamb, who\r\nwrote with a delicate fancy and tenderness that are more lasting than\r\nCarlyle's solid preachings are likely to prove, and who \"stuttered his\r\nquaintness in snatches,\" says Haydon, \"like the fool in _Lear_, and with\r\nequal beauty.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a fine and wonderful glimpse of one side of Lamb given by Leigh\r\nHunt when he says he could have imagined him \"cracking a joke in the teeth\r\nof a ghost, and then melting into thin air himself out of sympathy with\r\nthe awful.\" In describing him, most of his friends emphasise \"the bland,\r\nsweet smile, with a touch of sadness in it.\" \"A light frame, so fragile\r\nthat it seemed as if a breath would overthrow it,\" is Talfourd's picture\r\nof him, \"clad in clerk-like black, and surmounted by a head of form and\r\nexpression the most noble and sweet. His black hair curled crisply about\r\nan expanded forehead; his eyes, softly brown, twinkled with varying\r\nexpression, though the prevalent feeling was sad; and the nose slightly\r\ncurved, and delicately carved at the nostril, with the lower outline of\r\nthe face regularly oval, completed a head which was finely placed on the\r\nshoulders, and gave importance and even dignity to a diminutive and\r\nshadowy stem. Who shall describe his countenance, catch its quivering\r\nsweetness, and fix it for ever in words? There are none, alas, to answer\r\nthe vain desire of friendship. Deep thought, striving with humour; the\r\nlines of suffering wreathed into cordial mirth; and a smile of painful\r\nsweetness, present an image to the mind it can as little describe as lose.\r\nHis personal appearance and manner are not unfitly characterised by what\r\nhe himself says in one of his letters to Manning of Braham--'a compound of\r\nthe Jew, the gentleman, and the angel.'\" Add to this the sketch that\r\nPatmore has left of him: \"In point of intellectual character and\r\nexpression, a finer face was never seen, nor one more fully, however\r\nvaguely, corresponding with the mind whose features it interpreted. There\r\nwas the gravity usually engendered by a life passed in book-learning,\r\nwithout the slightest tinge of that assumption and affectation which\r\nalmost always attend the gravity so engendered; the intensity and\r\nelevation of general expression that mark high genius, without any of its\r\npretension and its oddity; the sadness waiting on fruitless thoughts and\r\nbaffled aspirations, but no evidence of that spirit of scorning and\r\ncontempt which these are apt to engender. Above all, there was a pervading\r\nsweetness and gentleness which went straight to the heart of every one who\r\nlooked on it; and not the less so, perhaps, that it bore about it an air,\r\na something, seeming to tell that it was not _put on_--for nothing could\r\nbe more unjust than to tax Lamb with assuming anything, even a virtue,\r\nwhich he did not possess--but preserved and persevered in, spite of\r\nopposing and contradictory feelings within that struggled in vain for\r\nmastery. It was a thing to remind you of that painful smile which bodily\r\ndisease and agony will sometimes put on, to conceal their sufferings from\r\nthe observation of those they love.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a look--this look of patient endurance, of smiling resignation, of\r\npainful cheerfulness--that you could not understand unless you were aware\r\nof the appalling tragedy that lay in the background of his life, and of\r\nthe haunting dread, the anxious, daily anticipation of disaster, and the\r\nneed of concealing this anxiety from her, that were involved in the\r\nmatter-of-course self-sacrifice with which he devoted himself to the care\r\nand guardianship of his sister, Mary.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1796, when Lamb was living with his father and mother and sister\r\nin lodgings in Little Queen Street, that the tragedy happened which was to\r\novershadow all his after years. The father was drifting into second\r\nchildhood, the mother an invalid. Mary Lamb had to attend upon them both,\r\nwith the help of a small servant and, in addition, took in plain sewing;\r\nCharles was a junior clerk at the India House. Only a little while before\r\nLamb had himself suffered a mental breakdown and had been placed under\r\ntemporary restraint (\"the six weeks that finished last year,\" he writes to\r\nColeridge, in May 1796, \"your very humble servant spent very agreeably in\r\na madhouse, at Hoxton. I am got somewhat rational now, and don't bite any\r\none. But mad I was\"); then, in September 1796, his sister suddenly went\r\nout of her mind, stabbed her mother to the heart, and in her frenzy threw\r\nknives at others in the room, and wounded her father before Lamb could\r\nseize her and get her under control. There are no letters more terrible or\r\nmore pathetic than those he wrote to Coleridge, when the horror and\r\nheartbreak of this event was fresh upon him.\r\n\r\n    \"My dearest Friend,\" he writes on the 27th September 1796, \"White, or\r\n    some of my friends, or the public papers, by this time have informed\r\n    you of the terrible calamities that have fallen on our family. I will\r\n    only give you the outlines. My poor dear, dearest sister, in a fit of\r\n    insanity, has been the death of her own mother. I was at hand only\r\n    time enough to snatch the knife out of her grasp. She is at present in\r\n    a madhouse, from whence I fear she must be moved to an hospital. God\r\n    has preserved to me my senses: I eat, and drink, and sleep, and have\r\n    my judgment, I believe, very sound. My poor father was slightly\r\n    wounded, and I am left to take care of him and my aunt. Mr. Norris, of\r\n    the Bluecoat School, has been very kind to us, and we have no other\r\n    friend; but thank God I am very calm and composed, and able to do the\r\n    best that remains to do. Write as religious a letter as possible, but\r\n    no mention of what is gone and done with. With me 'the former things\r\n    are passed away,' and I have something more to do than to feel. God\r\n    Almighty have us all in His keeping!\r\n\r\n      \"C. LAMB.\r\n\r\n    \"Mention nothing of poetry. I have destroyed every vestige of past\r\n    vanities of that kind. Do as you please, but if you publish, publish\r\n    mine (I give free leave) without name or initial, and never send me a\r\n    book, I charge you.\r\n\r\n    \"Your own judgment will convince you not to take any notice of this\r\n    yet to your dear wife. You look after your family; I have my reason\r\n    and strength left to take care of mine. I charge you, don't think of\r\n    coming to see me. Write. I will not see you if you come. God Almighty\r\n    love you and all of us!\r\n\r\n      \"C. LAMB.\"\r\n\r\nThe book he mentions is one that he and Coleridge and Lloyd were arranging\r\nto publish together. In October there is another letter, replying to one\r\nfrom Coleridge, and saying his sister is restored to her senses--a long\r\nletter from which I shall quote only one or two memorable passages: \"God\r\nbe praised, Coleridge! wonderful as it is to tell, I have never once been\r\notherwise than collected and calm; even on that dreadful day, and in the\r\nmidst of the terrible scene, I preserved a tranquillity which bystanders\r\nmay have construed into indifference--a tranquillity not of despair. Is it\r\nfolly or sin in me to say that it was a religious principle that _most_\r\nsupported me? I allow much to other favourable circumstances. I felt that\r\nI had something else to do than to regret. On that first evening my aunt\r\nwas lying insensible--to all appearance like one dying; my father, with\r\nhis poor forehead plaistered over from a wound he had received from a\r\ndaughter, dearly loved by him, and who loved him no less dearly; my mother\r\na dead and murdered corpse in the next room; yet was I wonderfully\r\nsupported. I closed not my eyes in sleep that night, but lay without\r\nterrors and without despair. I have lost no sleep since.... One little\r\nincident may serve to make you understand my way of managing my mind.\r\nWithin a day or two after the fatal one, we dressed for dinner a tongue,\r\nwhich we had had salted for some weeks in the house. As I sat down, a\r\nfeeling like remorse struck me: this tongue poor Mary got for me; and can\r\nI partake of it now, when she is far away? A thought occurred and relieved\r\nme: if I give in to this way of feeling, there is not a chair, a room, an\r\nobject in our rooms, that will not awaken the keenest griefs. I must rise\r\nabove such weaknesses. I hope this was not want of true feeling. I did not\r\nlet this carry me, though, too far. On the very second day (I date from\r\nthe day of horrors), as is usual in such cases, there were a matter of\r\ntwenty people, I do think, supping in our room: they prevailed on me to\r\neat _with them_ (for to eat I never refused). They were all making merry\r\nin the room! Some had come from friendship, some from busy curiosity, and\r\nsome from interest. I was going to partake with them, when my recollection\r\ncame that my poor dead mother was lying in the next room--the very next\r\nroom--a mother who, through life, wished nothing but her children's\r\nwelfare. Indignation, the rage of grief, something like remorse, rushed\r\nupon my mind. In an agony of emotion I found my way mechanically to the\r\nadjoining room, and fell on my knees by the side of her coffin, asking\r\nforgiveness of Heaven, and sometimes of her, for forgetting her so soon.\r\nTranquillity returned, and it was the only violent emotion that mastered\r\nme. I think it did me good.\"\r\n\r\nThrough all his subsequent letters from time to time there are touching\r\nlittle references to his sister's illnesses: she is away, again and again,\r\nin the asylum, or in charge of nurses, and he is alone and miserable, but\r\nlooking forward to her recovering presently and returning home. Once when\r\nthey are away from London on a visit, she is suddenly taken with one of\r\nthese frenzies, and on the way back to town he has to borrow a waistcoat\r\nto restrain her violence in the coach. But his love and loyalty were proof\r\nagainst it all; nothing would induce him to separate from her or let her\r\ngo out of his charge, except during those intervals when she was so\r\nderanged as to be a danger to others and to herself.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of 1799 Lamb moved into the Temple and, first at Mitre Court\r\nBuildings, then in Middle Temple Lane, he resided there, near the house of\r\nhis birth, for some seventeen years in all. In these two places he and his\r\nsister kept open house every Wednesday evening, and Hazlitt and Talfourd,\r\nBarry Cornwall, Holcroft, Godwin, and, when they were in town, Wordsworth\r\nand Coleridge were among their guests. Hazlitt and Talfourd and others\r\nhave told us something of those joyous evenings in the small, dingy rooms,\r\ncomfortable with books and old prints, where cold beef and porter stood\r\nready on the sideboard for the visitors to help themselves, and whilst\r\nwhoever chose sat and played at whist the rest fleeted the golden hours in\r\njest and conversation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILL'S COFFEE HOUSE. RUSSELL STREET.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1817 the Lambs took lodgings at 20 Russell Street,\r\nCovent Garden, a house which was formerly part of Will's famous Coffee\r\nHouse, which Dryden used to frequent, having his summer seat by the\r\nfireside and his winter seat in the balcony, as chief of the wits and men\r\nof letters who made it their place of resort. In a letter to Dorothy\r\nWordsworth, Mary Lamb reports their change of address: \"We have left the\r\nTemple. I think you will be sorry to hear this. I know I have never been\r\nso well satisfied with thinking of you at Rydal Mount as when I could\r\nconnect the idea of you with your own Grasmere Cottage. Our rooms were\r\ndirty and out of repair, and the inconvenience of living in chambers\r\nbecame every year more irksome, and so, at last, we mustered up resolution\r\nenough to leave the good old place that so long had sheltered us, and here\r\nwe are living at a brazier's shop, No. 20 Russell Street, Covent Garden, a\r\nplace all alive with noise and bustle; Drury Lane Theatre in sight from\r\nour front, and Covent Garden from our back windows. The hubbub of the\r\ncarriages returning from the play does not annoy me in the least; strange\r\nthat it does not, for it is quite tremendous. I quite enjoy looking out of\r\nthe window, and listening to the calling up of the carriages, and the\r\nsquabbles of the coachmen and linkboys. It is the oddest scene to look\r\ndown upon; I am sure you would be amused with it. It is well I am in a\r\ncheerful place, or I should have many misgivings about leaving the\r\nTemple.\" And on the 21st November 1817, Lamb also writes to Dorothy\r\nWordsworth: \"Here we are, transplanted from our native soil. I thought we\r\nnever could be torn up from the Temple. Indeed it was an ugly wrench, but\r\nlike a tooth, now 'tis out, and I am easy. We never can strike root so\r\ndeep in any other ground. This, where we are, is a light bit of gardener's\r\nmould, and if they take us up from it, it will cost no blood and groans,\r\nlike mandrakes pulled up. We are in the individual spot I like best in all\r\nthis great city. The theatres, with all their noises. Covent Garden,\r\ndearer to me than any gardens of Alcinous, where we are morally sure of\r\nthe earliest peas and 'sparagus. Bow Street, where the thieves are\r\nexamined, within a few yards of us. Mary had not been here four-and-twenty\r\nhours before she saw a thief. She sits at the window working; and casually\r\nthrowing out her eyes, she sees a concourse of people coming this way,\r\nwith a constable to conduct the solemnity. These little incidents\r\nagreeably diversify a female life.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Russell Street, from 1817 till 1823, Lamb\r\npublished in two volumes a collection of his miscellaneous writings, and\r\ncontributed the _Essays of Elia_ to the _London Magazine_, which makes\r\nthis Russell Street house, in a sense, the most notable of his various\r\nLondon homes. Here he continued his social gatherings, but had no regular\r\nevening for them, sending forth announcements periodically, such as that\r\nhe sent to Ayrton in 1823: \"Cards and cold mutton in Russell Street on\r\nFriday at 8 & 9. Gin and jokes from 1/2 past that time to 12. Pass this on\r\nto Mr. Payne, and apprize Martin thereof\"--Martin being Martin Burney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMB. COLEBROOKE ROW.]\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of this year he has flitted from Covent Garden, and on the\r\n2nd September writes to Bernard Barton: \"When you come London-ward you\r\nwill find me no longer in Covent Garden. I have a cottage in Colebrooke\r\nRow, Islington. A cottage, for it is detached; a white house, with six\r\ngood rooms, the New River (rather elderly by this time) runs (if a\r\nmoderate walking pace can be so termed) close to the foot of the house;\r\nand behind is a spacious garden, with vines (I assure you), pears,\r\nstrawberries, parsnips, leeks, carrots, cabbages, to delight the heart of\r\nold Alcinous. You enter without passage into a cheerful dining-room, all\r\nstudded over and rough with old books, and above is a lightsome\r\ndrawing-room, three windows, full of choice prints. I feel like a great\r\nlord, never having had a house before\"; and writing at the end of that\r\nweek to invite Allsop to dinner on Sunday he supplies him with these\r\ndirections: \"Colebrook Cottage, left hand side, end of Colebrook Row, on\r\nthe western brink of the New River, a detached whitish house.\" To Barton,\r\nwhen he has been nearly three weeks at Islington, he says, \"I continue to\r\nestimate my own roof-comforts highly. How could I remain all my life a\r\nlodger! My garden thrives (I am told), though I have yet reaped nothing\r\nbut some tiny salad and withered carrots. But a garden's a garden\r\nanywhere, and twice a garden in London.\"\r\n\r\nHere, in November of that year, happened the accident to George Dyer that\r\nsupplied Lamb with the subject of his whimsical Elian essay, _Amicus\r\nRedivivus_. Dyer was an odd, eccentric, very absent-minded old bookworm\r\nwho lived in Clifford's Inn; Lamb delighted in his absurdities, and loved\r\nhim, and loved to make merry over his quaint sayings and doings. \"You have\r\nseen our house,\" he writes to Mrs. Hazlitt, in the week after Dyer's\r\nadventure. \"What I now tell you is literally true. Yesterday week George\r\nDyer called upon us at one o'clock (_bright noonday_) on his way to dine\r\nwith Mrs. Barbauld at Newington. He sat with Mary about half-an-hour, and\r\ntook leave. The maid saw him go out, from her kitchen window, but suddenly\r\nlosing sight of him, ran up in a fright to Mary. G. D., instead of keeping\r\nthe slip that leads to the gate, had deliberately, staff in hand, in broad\r\nopen day, marched into the New River. He had not his spectacles on, and\r\nyou know his absence. Who helped him out they can hardly tell, but between\r\n'em they got him out, drenched through and through. A mob collected by\r\nthat time, and accompanied him in. 'Send for the Doctor,' they said: and a\r\none-eyed fellow, dirty and drunk, was fetched from the public-house at the\r\nend, where it seems he lurks for the sake of picking up water practice;\r\nhaving formerly had a medal from the Humane Society for some rescue. By\r\nhis advice the patient was put between blankets; and when I came home at\r\nfour to dinner, I found G. D. abed and raving, light-headed with the\r\nbrandy and water which the doctor had administered. He sang, laughed,\r\nwhimpered, screamed, babbled of guardian angels, would get up and go home;\r\nbut we kept him there by force; and by next morning he departed sober, and\r\nseems to have received no injury.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he left Islington the India Company bestowed upon Lamb the pension\r\nthat at last emancipated him from his \"dry drudgery at the desk's dead\r\nwood,\" and he communicates the great news exultantly to Wordsworth in a\r\nletter dated \"Colebrook Cottage,\" 6th April 1825: \"Here I am, then, after\r\nthirty-three years' slavery, sitting in my own room at eleven o'clock this\r\nfinest of all April mornings, a freed man, with \u00a3441 a year for the\r\nremainder of my life, live I as long as John Dennis, who outlived his\r\nannuity and starved at ninety: \u00a3441, _i.e._ \u00a3450, with a deduction of \u00a39\r\nfor a provision secured to my sister, she being survivor, the pension\r\nguaranteed by Act Georgii Tertii, &c. I came home FOR EVER on Tuesday in\r\nlast week. The incomprehensibleness of my condition overwhelmed me. It was\r\nlike passing from life into eternity. Every year to be as long as three,\r\n_i.e._ to have three times as much real time (time that is my own) in it!\r\nI wandered about thinking I was happy, but feeling I was not. But the\r\ntumultuousness is passing off, and I begin to understand the nature of the\r\ngift. Holydays, even the annual month, were always uneasy joys; their\r\nconscious fugitiveness; the craving after making the most of them. Now,\r\nwhen all is holyday, there are no holydays. I can sit at home in rain or\r\nshine without a restless impulse for walkings. I am daily steadying, and\r\nshall soon find it as natural to me to be my own master as it has been\r\nirksome to have had a master. Mary wakes every morning with an obscure\r\nfeeling that some good has happened to us.\"\r\n\r\nHe made use of these experiences in one of the best of his essays, that on\r\n_The Superannuated Man_, in which also you find echoes of a letter he\r\nwrote to Bernard Barton just after he had written to Wordsworth:\r\n\r\n\"I am free, B. B.--free as air.\r\n\r\n  'The little bird that wings the sky\r\n   Knows no such liberty!'\r\n\r\n\"I was set free on Tuesday in last week at four o'clock.\r\n\r\n  'I came home for ever!'\r\n\r\n\"I have been describing my feelings as well as I can to Wordsworth in a\r\nlong letter and don't care to repeat. Take it briefly that for a few days\r\nI was painfully oppressed by so mighty a change, but it is becoming daily\r\nmore natural to me. I went and sat among 'em all at my old thirty-three\r\nyears' desk yester morning; and deuce take me if I had not yearnings at\r\nleaving all my old pen-and-ink fellows, merry, sociable lads, at leaving\r\nthem in the lurch, fag, fag, fag! The comparison of my own superior\r\nfelicity gave me anything but pleasure. B. B. I would not serve another\r\nseven years for seven hundred thousand pounds.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Islington Lamb journeyed over to Highgate every now and then to visit\r\nColeridge at Mr. Gilman's; and a-visiting him at Colebrooke Cottage came\r\nColeridge, Southey, William Hone, and among many another, Hood, to whom he\r\ntook an especial liking. Coleridge thought he was the author of certain\r\nOdes that were then appearing in the _London Magazine_, but writing in\r\nreply Lamb assured him he was mistaken: \"The Odes are four-fifths done by\r\nHood, a silentish young man you met at Islington one day, an invalid. The\r\nrest are Reynolds's, whose sister H. has recently married.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the two years or more after his release from the India House, Lamb\r\nand his sister spent two or three short holidays lodging with a Mrs.\r\nLeishman at The Chase, Enfield; in 1827 they rented the house of her, and\r\nLamb wrote from that address on the 18th September to Hood, who was then\r\nliving at 2 Robert Street, Adelphi: \"Give our kind loves to all at\r\nHighgate, and tell them we have finally torn ourselves outright away from\r\nColebrooke, where I had _no_ health, and are about to domicilate for good\r\nat Enfield, where I have experienced good.\r\n\r\n  'Lord, what good hours do we keep!\r\n   How quietly we sleep!'...\r\n\r\nWe have got our books into our new house. I am a dray-horse if I was not\r\nashamed of the undigested dirty lumber, as I toppled 'em out of the cart,\r\nand blest Becky that came with 'em for her having an unstuffed brain with\r\nsuch rubbish.... 'Twas with some pain we were evulsed from Colebrook. You\r\nmay find some of our flesh sticking to the doorposts. To change\r\nhabitations is to die to them; and in my time I have died seven deaths.\r\nBut I don't know whether every such change does not bring with it a\r\nrejuvenescence. 'Tis an enterprise; and shoves back the sense of death's\r\napproximating which, though not terrible to me, is at all times\r\nparticularly distasteful. My house-deaths have generally been periodical,\r\nrecurring after seven years; but this last is premature by half that time.\r\nCut off in the flower of Colebrook!\" He mentions that the rent is 10s.\r\nless than he paid at Islington; that he pays, in fact, \u00a335 a year,\r\nexclusive of moderate taxes, and thinks himself lucky.\r\n\r\nBut the worry of moving brought on one of Mary Lamb's \"sad, long\r\nillnesses\"; and whilst she was absent, Lamb fled from the loneliness of\r\nhis country home to spend ten days in town. \"But Town,\" he writes to\r\nBarton, \"with all my native hankering after it, is not what it was. The\r\nstreets, the shops are left, but all old friends are gone. And in London I\r\nwas frightfully convinced of this as I past houses and places--empty\r\ncaskets now. I have ceased to care almost about anybody. The bodies I\r\ncared for are in graves or dispersed. My old Clubs, that lived so long and\r\nflourished so steadily, are crumbled away. When I took leave of our\r\nadopted young friend at Charing Cross, 'twas heavy unfeeling rain and I\r\nhad nowhere to go. Home have I none--and not a sympathising house to\r\nturn to in the great city. Never did the waters of the heaven pour down on\r\na forlorner head. Yet I tried ten days at a sort of friend's house, but it\r\nwas large and straggling--one of the individuals of my long knot of\r\nfriends, card-players, pleasant companions--that have tumbled to pieces\r\ninto dust and other things--and I got home on Thursday convinced that I\r\nwas better to get home to my hole at Enfield, and hide like a sick cat in\r\nmy corner. Less than a month, I hope, will bring home Mary. She is at\r\nFulham, looking better in her health than ever, but sadly rambling, and\r\nscarce showing any pleasure in seeing me, or curiosity when I should come\r\nagain. But the old feelings will come back again, and we shall drown old\r\nsorrows over a game of Picquet again. But 'tis a tedious cut out of a life\r\nof sixty-four, to lose twelve or thirteen weeks every year or two.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES LAMB]\r\n\r\nThe cares of housekeeping, however, sat too heavily on them, and in\r\nOctober 1829 they abandoned those responsibilities, gave up their cottage\r\non Chase Side, and went to lodge and board with their next-door\r\nneighbours, an old Mr. and Mrs. Westwood, and in this easier way of living\r\ntheir spirits and their health revived. Nevertheless, by January 1830 Lamb\r\nhad lost all his contentment with rural life, and was yearning desperately\r\nfor the remembered joys of London. \"And is it a year since we parted from\r\nyou at the steps of Edmonton stage?\" he writes to Wordsworth. \"There are\r\nnot now the years that there used to be.\" He frets, he says, like a lion\r\nin a net, and then goes on to utter that yearning to be back in London\r\nthat I have quoted already in my opening chapter. \"Back-looking\r\nambition,\" he continues, \"tells me I might still be a Londoner! Well, if\r\nwe ever do move, we have incumbrances the less to impede us; all our\r\nfurniture has faded under the auctioneer's hammer, going for nothing, like\r\nthe tarnished frippery of the prodigal, and we have only a spoon or two\r\nleft to bless us. Clothed we came into Enfield, and naked we must go out\r\nof it. I would live in London shirtless, bookless.\" And to Bernard Barton\r\nhe says, \"With fire and candle-light I can dream myself in Holborn....\r\nGive me old London at Fire and Plague times, rather than these tepid\r\ngales, healthy country air, and purposeless exercise.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1833 he removed from Enfield, and his reasons for doing so he\r\nexplains in a letter to Mrs. Hazlitt, on the 31st May of that year: \"I am\r\ndriven from house to house by Mary's illness. I took a sudden resolution\r\nto take my sister to Edmonton, where she was under medical treatment last\r\ntime, and have arranged to board and lodge with the people. Thank God I\r\nhave repudiated Enfield. I have got out of hell, despair of heaven, and\r\nmust sit down contented in a half-way purgatory. Thus ends this strange\r\neventful history. But I am nearer to town, and will get up to you somehow\r\nbefore long.\" About the same date he wrote to Wordsworth: \"Mary is ill\r\nagain. Her illnesses encroach yearly. The last was three months, followed\r\nby two of depression most dreadful. I look back upon her earlier attacks\r\nwith longing--nice little durations of six weeks or so, followed by\r\ncomplete restoration--shocking as they were to me then. In short, half her\r\nlife she is dead to me, and the other half is made anxious with fears and\r\nlookings forward to the next shock. With such prospects it seemed to me\r\nnecessary that she should no longer live with me, and be fluttered with\r\ncontinual removals; so I am come to live with her, at a Mr. Walden's, and\r\nhis wife, who take in patients, and have arranged to lodge and board us\r\nonly. They have had the care of her before. I see little of her: alas! I\r\ntoo often hear her. _Sunt lachrym\u00e6 rerum!_ and you and I must bear it....\r\nI am about to lose my old and only walk-companion, whose mirthful spirits\r\nwere the 'youth of our house,' Emma Isola. I have her here now for a\r\nlittle while, but she is too nervous properly to be under such a roof, so\r\nshe will make short visits--be no more an inmate. With my perfect approval\r\nand more than concurrence she is to be wedded to Moxon at the end of\r\nAugust--so 'perish the roses and the flowers'--how is it? Now to the\r\nbrighter side. I am emancipated from the Westwoods, and I am with\r\nattentive people and younger. I am three or four miles nearer the great\r\ncity; coaches half-price less and going always, of which I will avail\r\nmyself. I have few friends left there; one or two though, most beloved.\r\nBut London streets and faces cheer me inexpressibly, though not one known\r\nof the latter were remaining.\"\r\n\r\nEmma Isola is \"the adopted young friend\" referred to by Lamb in a letter\r\nquoted a few pages back. She was the granddaughter of an Italian refugee;\r\nher mother was dead; her father was an \"Esquire Bedell\" of Cambridge, and\r\nthe Lambs met her at the house of a friend when they were visiting that\r\ntown in 1823. She was a charming, brown-faced little girl, and they were\r\nso taken with her that she was invited to visit them in London during her\r\nholidays, and they ended by adopting her and calling her their niece. She\r\nbrought a great deal of happiness into their lives; Lamb gives whimsical\r\naccounts in some of his letters of how he is teaching her Latin, and his\r\nsister is prompting her in her French lessons. When she was old enough she\r\nbecame governess in the family of a Mr. and Mrs. Williams at Bury; fell\r\nill and was kindly nursed there; and Lamb tells in one of his most\r\ndelightful letters how he went to fetch her home to Enfield, when she was\r\nconvalescent, and it is good to glimpse how sympathetically amused he is\r\nat Emma's covert admonitions and anxiety lest he should drink too much, at\r\ndinner with the Williamses, and so bring disgrace upon himself and her.\r\n\r\nHis beautiful affection for their young ward shines through all the\r\ndrollery of his several notes to Edward Moxon (the publisher) in which he\r\nspeaks of their engagement; and it has always seemed to me it is this same\r\nunderlying affection for her and wistfulness to see her happy that help to\r\nmake the following letter, written just after the wedding, one of the\r\nfinest and most pathetic things in literature:--\r\n\r\n    \"_August 1833._\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR MR. AND MRS. MOXON,--Time very short. I wrote to Miss Fryer, and\r\n    had the sweetest letter about you, Emma, that ever friendship\r\n    dictated. 'I am full of good wishes, I am crying with good wishes,'\r\n    she says; but you shall see it.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Moxon, I take your writing most kindly, and shall most kindly\r\n    your writing from Paris. I want to crowd another letter to Miss Fryer\r\n    into the little time after dinner, before post time. So with twenty\r\n    thousand congratulations,--Yours,\r\n\r\n      C. L.\r\n\r\n    \"I am calm, sober, happy. Turn over for the reason. I got home from\r\n    Dover Street, by Evans, _half as sober as a judge_. I am turning over\r\n    a new leaf, as I hope you will now.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMB'S COTTAGE. EDMONTON.]\r\n\r\n[_The turn of the leaf presents the following_:--]\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR EMMA AND EDWARD MOXON,--Accept my sincere congratulations,\r\n    and imagine more good wishes than my weak nerves will let me put into\r\n    good set words. The dreary blank of _unanswered questions_ which I\r\n    ventured to ask in vain was cleared up on the wedding day by Mrs. W.\r\n    taking a glass of wine and, with a total change of countenance,\r\n    begging leave to drink Mr. and Mrs. Moxon's health. It restored me\r\n    from that moment, as if by an electrical stroke, to the entire\r\n    possession of my senses. I never felt so calm and quiet after a\r\n    similar illness as I do now. I feel as if all tears were wiped from my\r\n    eyes, and all care from my heart.\r\n\r\n      MARY LAMB.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Wednesday._\r\n\r\n    \"DEARS AGAIN,--Your letter interrupted a seventh game at picquet which\r\n    _we_ were having, after walking to Wright's and purchasing shoes. We\r\n    pass our time in cards, walks, and reading. We attack Tasso soon.\r\n\r\n      \"C. L.\r\n\r\n    \"Never was such a calm, or such a recovery. 'Tis her own words\r\n    undictated.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was in this plain, commonplace little cottage in Church Street,\r\nEdmonton, that Mary Lamb was thus suddenly awakened out of her\r\nderangement; that Charles Lamb and she wrote, by turns, that letter to the\r\nMoxons; that the Lambs sat contentedly playing picquet when the letter of\r\nthe bride and bridegroom came to them from Paris. These are the very rooms\r\nin which these things happened; the stage remains, but the actors are\r\ndeparted. Within a stone's throw of the house, in Edmonton Churchyard,\r\nLamb and his sister lie buried. His death was the result of an accident.\r\nHe had gone on his accustomed walk along the London Road, one day in\r\nDecember, when he stumbled and fell over a stone, slightly injuring his\r\nface. So trivial did the wound seem that writing to George Dyer's wife on\r\nthe 22nd December 1834, about a book he had lost when he was in\r\nLondon--\"it was the book I went to fetch from Miss Buffham's while the\r\ntripe was frying\"--he says nothing of anything being the matter with him.\r\nBut erysipelas supervened, and he grew rapidly worse, and died on the\r\n27th. His sister, who had lapsed into one of her illnesses and was\r\nunconscious, at the time, of her loss, outlived him by nearly thirteen\r\nyears, and reached the great age of eighty-two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nST. JOHN'S WOOD AND WIMBLEDON\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Lamb passed the later years of her life in a sort of nursing home at\r\nSt. John's Wood, and in her happier intervals kept up a pleasant\r\nacquaintance with some of the notable circle of friends who had gathered\r\nabout her and her brother aforetime; among others, with the Hoods, who\r\nwere then living in the same locality. Crabb Robinson mentions in his\r\nDiary how he made a call on Mary Lamb, and finding her well over one of\r\nher periodical attacks, \"quite in possession of her faculties and\r\nrecollecting nearly everything,\" he accompanied her on a visit to the\r\nHoods, who were lodging at 17 Elm Tree Road.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most graphic pictures we have of Hood's home life, and\r\nincidentally of Hood himself and his wife and of Charles and Mary Lamb, is\r\ncontained in the account that has been left by Miss Mary Balmanno of an\r\nevening she spent with the Hoods when they were making their home in\r\nRobert Street, Adelphi: \"Bound in the closest ties of friendship with the\r\nHoods, with whom we also were in the habit of continually associating, we\r\nhad the pleasure of meeting Charles Lamb at their house one evening,\r\ntogether with his sister, and several other friends.... In outward\r\nappearance Hood conveyed the idea of a clergyman. His figure slight, and\r\ninvariably dressed in black; his face pallid; the complexion delicate,\r\nand features regular: his countenance bespeaking sympathy by its sweet\r\nexpression of melancholy and suffering.\r\n\r\n\"Lamb was of a different mould and aspect. Of middle height, with brown\r\nand rather ruddy complexion, grey eyes expressive of sense and shrewdness,\r\nbut neither large nor brilliant; his head and features well shaped, and\r\nthe general expression of his countenance quiet, kind, and observant,\r\nundergoing rapid changes in conversation, as did his manner, variable as\r\nan April day, particularly to his sister, whose saint-like good humour and\r\npatience were as remarkable as his strange and whimsical modes of trying\r\nthem. But the brother and sister perfectly understood each other, and\r\n'Charles,' as she always called him, would not have been the Charles of\r\nher loving heart without the pranks and oddities which he was continually\r\nplaying off upon her, and which were only outnumbered by the instances of\r\naffection and evidences of ever-watchful solicitude with which he\r\nsurrounded her.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lamb, although many years older than her brother, by no means looked\r\nso, but presented the pleasant appearance of a mild, rather stout and\r\ncomely lady of middle age. Dressed with Quaker-like simplicity in\r\ndove-coloured silk, with a transparent kerchief of snow-white muslin\r\nfolded across her bosom, she at once prepossessed the beholder in her\r\nfavour by an aspect of serenity and peace. Her manners were very quiet and\r\ngentle, and her voice low. She smiled frequently, and seldom laughed,\r\npartaking of the courtesies and hospitalities of her merry host and\r\nhostess with all the cheerfulness and grace of a most mild and kindly\r\nnature. Her behaviour to her brother was like that of an admiring\r\ndisciple; her eyes seldom absent from his face. And when apparently\r\nengrossed in conversation with others, she would, by supplying some word\r\nfor which he was at a loss, even when talking in a distant part of the\r\nroom, show how closely her mind waited upon his. Mr. Lamb was in high\r\nspirits, sauntering about the room with his hands crossed behind his back,\r\nconversing by fits and starts with those most familiarly known to him....\"\r\n\r\nShe goes on to describe how Miss Kelly, the actress, amused them by\r\nimpersonating a character she was taking in a new play, and \"Mrs. Hood's\r\neyes sparkled with joy, as she saw the effect it had produced upon her\r\nhusband, whose pale face, like an illuminated comic mask, shone with fun\r\nand good humour. Never was a happier couple than the Hoods; 'mutual\r\nreliance and fond faith' seemed to be their motto. Mrs. Hood was a most\r\namiable woman--of excellent manners, and full of sincerity and goodness.\r\nShe perfectly adored her husband, tending him like a child, whilst he,\r\nwith unbounded affection, seemed to delight to yield himself to her\r\nguidance. Nevertheless, true to his humorous nature, he loved to tease her\r\nwith jokes and whimsical accusations, which were only responded to by,\r\n'Hood, Hood, how can you run on so?'\r\n\r\n\"The evening was concluded by a supper, one of those elegant social\r\nrepasts which Flemish artists delight to paint.... Mr. Lamb oddly walked\r\nround the table, looking closely at any dish that struck his fancy before\r\nhe would decide where to sit, telling Mrs. Hood that he should by that\r\nmeans know how to select some dish that was difficult to carve and take\r\nthe trouble off her hands; accordingly, having jested in this manner, he\r\nplaced himself with great deliberation before a lobster salad, observing\r\n_that_ was the thing.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hood, with inexpressible gravity in the upper part of his face and\r\nhis mouth twitching with smiles, sang his own comic song of 'If you go to\r\nFrance be sure you learn the lingo'; his pensive manner and feeble voice\r\nmaking it doubly ludicrous. Mr. Lamb, on being pressed to sing, excused\r\nhimself in his own peculiar manner, but offered to pronounce a Latin\r\neulogium instead. This was accepted, and he accordingly stammered forth a\r\nlong stream of Latin words; among which, as the name of Mrs. Hood\r\nfrequently occurred, we ladies thought it in praise of her. The delivery\r\nof this speech occupied about five minutes. On inquiring of a gentleman\r\nwho sat next me whether Mr. Lamb was praising Mrs. Hood, he informed me\r\nthat was by no means the case, the eulogium being on the lobster salad!\r\nThus, in the gayest of moods, progressed and concluded a truly merry\r\nlittle social supper, worthy in all respects of the author of _Whims and\r\nOddities_.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this, when the Hoods came to St. John's Wood, lay thirteen years\r\nbehind them, and Lamb had been eight years dead. Quitting the Adelphi in\r\n1829, Hood went to Winchmore Hill, then to Wanstead; then, after some five\r\nyears of residence in Germany and Belgium, he returned to England, and\r\nmade his home for a short time at Camberwell, and thence in 1842 removed\r\nto St. John's Wood--at first to rooms at 17 Elm Tree Road, and in 1844 to\r\na house of his own, \"Devonshire Lodge,\" in the Finchley Road--a house\r\nthat the guide-books all tell us was demolished, but since I started to\r\nwrite this chapter the London County Council has identified as \"Devonshire\r\nLodge\" the house that still stands in Finchley Road, immediately adjoining\r\nthe Marlborough Road station of the Metropolitan Railway; and here it was\r\nthat Hood died on the 3rd of May 1845.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOM HOOD'S HOUSE. ST JOHN'S WOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe room in which he worked at 17 Elm Tree Road gave him a view of Lord's\r\nCricket Ground, and he complained that this was a drawback, because \"when\r\nhe was at work he could often see others at play.\" He caricatured the\r\nlandlady of the house, who had \"a large and personal love of flowers,\" and\r\nmade her the heroine of his _Mrs. Gardiner, A Horticultural Romance_. From\r\nElm Tree Road he went to attend the dinner at Greenwich that was given to\r\nDickens on his second return from America; and describing this dissipation\r\nin a letter to a friend he says, \"You will be pleased to hear that, in\r\nspite of my warnings and forebodings, I got better and betterer, till by\r\ndining, as the physicians did, on turtle soup, white-bait, and champagne,\r\nI seemed quite well.\" He was to have been chairman at the dinner, but\r\nexcused himself on the score of ill-health, and Captain Marryat took his\r\nplace. The diners included, in addition to Dickens himself, Moncton\r\nMilnes, Forster, Clarkson Stanfield, Ainsworth, Landseer (another St.\r\nJohn's Wood resident), Cruikshank, Cattermole, \"Ingoldsby\" Barham, and\r\nBarry Cornwall. Being called upon for a speech, Hood said he supposed they\r\ndrank his health because he was a notorious invalid, but assured the\r\ncompany that the trembling of his hand was neither from palsy nor ague,\r\nbut that their wishes had already so improved his circulation and filled\r\nhim with genial warmth that his hand had a natural inclination to shake\r\nitself with every one present. Whereupon everybody within reach, and some\r\nwho were not, insisted upon shaking hands with him. \"_Very_ gratifying,\r\nwasn't it?\" he finishes his letter. \"Though I cannot go quite so far as\r\nJane, who wants me to have that hand chopped off, bottled, and preserved\r\nin spirits. She was sitting up for me, very anxiously, as usual when I go\r\nout, because I am so domestic and steady, and was down at the door before\r\nI could ring at the gate, to which Boz kindly sent me in his own carriage.\r\nPoor girl! what _would_ she do if she had a wild husband instead of a tame\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nDickens, at that date, lived at 1 Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone Road;\r\nthey had probably driven up together from Greenwich, and the carriage had\r\ncome the mile or so further on with Hood after leaving Dickens at his own\r\ndoor. Dickens was one of the many visitors who have helped to make Hood's\r\nSt. John's Wood residence memorable; there is a record of his being there,\r\nwith his wife and sister and Daniel Maclise, in December 1842. At Elm Tree\r\nRoad, for all his broken health, Hood worked hard at editing and writing\r\nfor the _New Monthly Magazine_, and, after resigning from that, for\r\n_Hood's Monthly Magazine_. One letter of his, dated from 17 Elm Tree Road,\r\non the 18th July 1843, is headed \"From my bed\"; for he was frequently\r\nbedridden for days and weeks at a stretch, but sat propped up with\r\npillows, writing and sketching with unabated industry. He was contributing\r\nalso in these days to _Punch_, and to Douglas Jerrold's _Illuminated\r\nMagazine_. In November 1843 he wrote here, for _Punch_, his grim _Drop of\r\nGin_:\r\n\r\n  \"Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin!\r\n   What magnified monsters circle therein!\r\n     Ragged, and stained with filth and mud,\r\n     Some plague-spotted, and some with blood!\r\n   Shapes of misery, shame, and sin!\r\n     Figures that make us loathe and tremble,\r\n     Creatures scarce human, that more resemble\r\n   Broods of diabolical kin,\r\n   Ghost and vampyre, demon and Jin!...\"\r\n\r\nBut a far greater poem than this, _The Song of the Shirt_, was also\r\nwritten at Elm Tree Road. \"Now mind, Hood, mark my words,\" said Mrs. Hood,\r\nwhen he was putting up the manuscript for the post, \"this will tell\r\nwonderfully. It is one of the best things you ever did.\" And the results\r\njustified her. The verses appeared in the Christmas Number of _Punch_ for\r\n1843, and not only trebled the circulation of that paper, but within a\r\nvery short time had at least doubled Hood's reputation, though _Eugene\r\nAram_, _The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies_, and _Lycus the Centaur_, had\r\nlong preceded it. Probably no poem ever stirred the national conscience\r\nmore deeply or created a profounder sensation. Shortly after its\r\nappearance Cowden Clarke met Hood, and has left a vivid description of his\r\npersonal appearance in those last months of his life. His worn, pallid\r\nlook, he says, \"strangely belied the effect of jocularity and high spirits\r\nconveyed by his writings. He punned incessantly, but languidly, almost as\r\nif unable to think in any other way than in play upon words. His smile was\r\nattractively sweet; it bespoke the affectionate-natured man which his\r\nserious verses--those especially addressed to his wife or his\r\nchildren--show him to be, and it also revealed the depth of pathos in his\r\nsoul that inspired his _Bridge of Sighs_, _Song of the Shirt_, and _Eugene\r\nAram_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS HOOD]\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting points of resemblance between Hood and Lamb.\r\nBoth were inveterate punsters; each had known poverty, and had come\r\nthrough hard experiences that had left their marks upon them, yet had\r\nnever soured them or warped their sympathies. You may use the same\r\nepithets for both: they were homely, kindly, gentle, given to freakish\r\nmoods and whimsical jesting; the one was as unselfishly devoted to his\r\nsister as the other was to his wife and children; and in descriptions of\r\nHood, as of Lamb, stress is laid on the peculiar wistfulness and sweetness\r\nof his smile. But after the East India Company had handsomely pensioned\r\nhim off, Lamb had no further financial anxieties; whilst Hood had to\r\nsuppress his finer gifts, and to the end of his days turn his hand to all\r\nmanner of inferior but more popular work, that would enable him to keep\r\nthe family pot boiling. And he was all the while fighting against disease\r\nas well as poverty. He could not afford to go into exile, like Stevenson,\r\nand lengthen his days and foster his wasting strength in a healthfuller\r\nclimate. He was never rich enough to have any choice but to die in the\r\nplace where he had to earn his living, and no man ever worked more\r\nmanfully, or died at his post bravelier or with a more cheery philosophy.\r\n\r\nRead the humorous preface he wrote for the volume of _Hood's Own_, whilst\r\nhe lay ill abed there in his St. John's Wood house: it is the sort of\r\nhumour that makes your heart ache, for you cannot forget that he was\r\nracked with pain and slowly dying whilst he wrote it. He jests about the\r\naristocratic, ghastly slenderness of his fingers; his body, he says, may\r\ncry craven, but luckily his mind has no mind to give in. \"'Things may take\r\na turn,' as the pig said on the spit.... As to health? it's the weather of\r\nthe body--it rains, it hails, it blows, it snows at present, but it may\r\nclear up by-and-by\"; and in conclusion he mentions that the doctor tells\r\nhim, \"anatomically my heart is lower hung than usual, but what of that?\r\n_The more need to keep it up!_\" Raised up in bed, with an improvised desk\r\nacross his knees, he was hard at work, writing prose and verse and\r\nknocking off grotesque little drawings, and remained, as he said, \"a\r\nlively Hood to get a livelihood,\" almost to his last hour. When, towards\r\nthe end, his wife was trying to relieve his sufferings by putting a\r\npoultice on his emaciated body, he laughed up at her quizzically, and\r\nasked if she didn't think \"it seemed a deal of mustard for such a little\r\nmeat.\" He had moved into Devonshire Lodge, and was within sixteen months\r\nof his death when he wrote _The Haunted House_, and _The Bridge of Sighs_.\r\n\"I fear that so far as I myself am concerned,\" he writes to Thackeray in\r\nAugust 1844, \"King Death will claim me ere many months elapse. However,\r\nthere's a good time coming, if not in this world, most assuredly in the\r\nnext.\" When he was invited next month to attend a soir\u00e9e at the Manchester\r\nAthen\u00e6um, he had to decline, and added, \"For me all long journeys are over\r\nsave one\"; but a couple of months later he had written the _Lay of the\r\nLabourer_, for his magazine, and writing to Lord Lytton remarked that\r\nthough the doctor had ordered him not to work he was compelled to do so,\r\nand \"so it will be to the end. I must die in harness, like a hero--or a\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DIBDIN. 34 ARLINGTON ROAD.]\r\n\r\nHis dying hours were made easy by the pension of a hundred pounds that Sir\r\nRobert Peel kindly and tactfully settled on Mrs. Hood, and one of the last\r\nthings he wrote on his lingering deathbed was a valediction that\r\nbreathed all of resignation and hope:\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell, Life! My senses swim\r\n   And the world is growing dim;\r\n   Thronging shadows cloud the light,\r\n   Like the advent of the night,--\r\n   Colder, colder, colder still\r\n   Upwards steals a vapour chill--\r\n   Strong the earthy odour grows--\r\n   I smell the Mould above the Rose!\r\n\r\n   Welcome, Life! The Spirit strives!\r\n   Strength returns, and hope revives;\r\n   Cloudy fears and shapes forlorn\r\n   Fly like shadows at the morn,--\r\n   O'er the earth there comes a bloom--\r\n   Sunny light for sullen gloom,\r\n   Warm perfume for vapour cold--\r\n   I smell the Rose above the Mould!\"\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer lived in St. John's Wood for many years, at 7 Marlborough\r\nGardens, 13 Loudon Road, and 64 Avenue Road successively. Within an easy\r\nwalk of Avenue Road, at 34 Arlington Road, Camden Town, Charles Dibdin,\r\nwhose memory survives in _Tom Bowling_, passed the last years of his life.\r\nAnd, back in St. John's Wood, at the Priory, 21 North Bank, in one of the\r\nnumerous houses that were swept away when the Great Central Railway came\r\nto Marylebone, George Eliot lived from 1864 until 1880, when she removed\r\nto Chelsea. Before that, from 1860 till 1863, lived in a house in\r\nBlandford Square, which has also been demolished; but for nearly two years\r\nbefore going there she resided at Holly Lodge, which still survives, in\r\nthe Wimbledon Park Road.\r\n\r\nThere is an entry in her Diary dated 6th February 1859: \"Yesterday we went\r\nto take possession of Holly Lodge, which is to be our dwelling, we expect,\r\nfor years to come. It was a deliciously fresh, bright day. I will accept\r\nthe omen. A letter came from Blackwood telling me the result of the\r\nsubscription to _Adam Bede_, which was published on the 1st: 730 copies,\r\nMudie having taken 500 on the publisher's terms--10 per cent. off the sale\r\nprice. At first he had stood out for a larger reduction, and would only\r\ntake 50, but at last he came round. In this letter Blackwood tells me the\r\nfirst _ab extra_ opinion of the book, which happened to be precisely what\r\nI most desired. A cabinetmaker (brother to Blackwood's managing clerk) had\r\nread the sheets, and declared the writer must have been brought up to the\r\nbusiness, or at least had listened to the workmen in their workshop.\" She\r\nwrote that month to Miss Sara Hennell, \"We are tolerably settled now,\r\nexcept that we have only a temporary servant; and I shall not be quite at\r\nease until I have a trustworthy woman who will manage without incessant\r\ndogging. Our home is very comfortable, with far more vulgar indulgences in\r\nit than I ever expected to have again; but you must not imagine it a snug\r\nplace, just peeping above the holly bushes. Imagine it rather as a tall\r\ncake, with a low garnish of holly and laurel. As it is, we are very well\r\noff, with glorious breezy walks, and wide horizons, well-ventilated rooms,\r\nand abundant water. If I allowed myself to have any longings beyond what\r\nis given, they would be for a nook quite in the country, far away from\r\npalaces--Crystal or otherwise--with an orchard behind me full of old\r\ntrees, and rough grass and hedgerow paths among the endless fields\r\nwhere you meet nobody. We talk of such things sometimes, along with old\r\nage and dim faculties, and a small independence to save us from writing\r\ndrivel for dishonest money.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE ELIOT. WIMBLEDON PARK.]\r\n\r\nThe \"we\" in these entries means, of course, herself and George Henry\r\nLewes; they formed an irregular union in 1854, and lived as husband and\r\nwife until his death in 1878. In George Eliot's Journal and letters are a\r\ngood many other references to her life at Holly Lodge, of which the most\r\ninteresting are perhaps the following:\r\n\r\n_April 29th, 1859_ (from the Journal): \"Finished a story, _The Lifted\r\nVeil_, which I began one morning at Richmond as a resource when my head\r\nwas too stupid for more important work. Resumed my new novel\" (this was\r\n_The Mill on the Floss_), \"of which I am going to rewrite the two first\r\nchapters. I shall call it provisionally _The Tullivers_, or perhaps _St.\r\nOgg's on the Floss_.\"\r\n\r\n_May 6th_ (from a letter to Major Blackwood): \"Yes I _am_ assured now that\r\n_Adam Bede_ was worth writing--worth living through long years to write.\r\nBut now it seems impossible to me that I shall ever write anything so good\r\nand true again. I have arrived at faith in the past but not faith in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n_May 19th_ (from Journal): \"A letter from Blackwood, in which he proposes\r\nto give me another \u00a3400 at the end of the year, making in all \u00a31200, as an\r\nacknowledgment of _Adam Bede's_ success.\"\r\n\r\n_June 8th_ (from a letter to Mrs. Congreve): \"I want to get rid of this\r\nhouse--cut cable and drift about. I dislike Wandsworth, and should think\r\nwith unmitigated regret of our coming here if it were not for you.\"\r\n\r\n_July 21st_ (from the Journal, on returning after a holiday in\r\nSwitzerland): \"Found a charming letter from Dickens, and pleasant letters\r\nfrom Blackwood--nothing to annoy us.\"\r\n\r\n_November 10th_ (from the Journal): \"Dickens dined with us to-day for the\r\nfirst time.\"\r\n\r\n_December 15th_ (from the Journal): \"Blackwood proposes to give me for\r\n_The Mill on the Floss_, \u00a32000 for 4000 copies of an edition at 31s. 6d.,\r\nand afterwards the same rate for any more copies printed at the same\r\nprice; \u00a3150 for 1000 at 12s.; and \u00a360 for 1000 at 6s. I have accepted.\"\r\n\r\n_January 3rd, 1860_ (from a letter to John Blackwood): \"We are demurring\r\nabout the title. Mr. Lewes is beginning to prefer _The House of Tulliver,\r\nor Life on the Floss_, to our old notion of _Sister Maggie_. _The\r\nTullivers, or Life on the Floss_ has the advantage of slipping easily off\r\nthe lazy English tongue, but it is after too common a fashion (_The\r\nNewcomes_, _The Bertrams_, &c., &c.). Then there is _The Tulliver Family,\r\nor Life on the Floss_. Pray meditate and give us your opinion.\"\r\n\r\n_January 16th, 1860_ (from the Journal): \"Finished my second volume this\r\nmorning, and am going to send off the MS. of the first volume to-morrow.\r\nWe have decided that the title shall be _The Mill on the Floss_.\"\r\n\r\n_February 23rd_ (from a letter to John Blackwood): \"Sir Edward Lytton\r\ncalled on us yesterday. The conversation lapsed chiefly into monologue,\r\nfrom the difficulty I found in making him hear, but under all\r\ndisadvantages I had an agreeable impression of his kindness and\r\nsincerity. He thinks the two defects of _Adam Bede_ are the dialect and\r\nAdam's marriage with Dinah, but of course I would have my teeth drawn\r\nrather than give up either.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE ELIOT'S HOUSE. CHELSEA.]\r\n\r\n_July 1st_ (from a letter to Madame Bodichon, on returning to Holly Lodge\r\nafter a two months' holiday in Italy): \"We are preparing to renounce the\r\ndelights of roving, and to settle down quietly, as old folks should do....\r\nWe have let our present house.\"\r\n\r\nOne interesting memorial of the life at Holly Lodge is the MS. of _The\r\nMill on the Floss_, on which is inscribed in George Eliot's handwriting:\r\n\"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third\r\nbook, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge,\r\nSouth Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21st March 1860.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of _The Mill on the Floss_, and, in the three succeeding\r\nyears, of _Silas Marner_ and _Romola_, carried George Eliot to the height\r\nof her fame, and by the time she was living in North Bank, St. John's\r\nWood, she had her little circle of adoring worshippers, who, like George\r\nHenry Lewes, took her very seriously indeed. That sort of hero-worship was\r\ncustomary in those days, unless the worshipped one had too strong a sense\r\nof humour to put up with it. There is a passage in the Autobiography of\r\nMr. Alfred Austin giving a brief account of a visit he paid to George\r\nEliot. \"We took the first opportunity,\" he says, \"of going to call on her\r\nat her request in St. John's Wood. But there I found pervading her house\r\nan attitude of adoration, not to say an atmosphere almost of awe,\r\nthoroughly alien to my idea that persons of genius, save in their works,\r\nshould resemble other people as much as possible, and not allow any\r\nspecial fuss to be made about them. I do not say the fault lay with her.\"\r\nBut you find the same circumstance spoken to elsewhere, and the general\r\nnotion you gather is that George Eliot rather enjoyed this being\r\npedestalled, and accepted the incense of her reverent little circle with a\r\ngood deal of complacency.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Lewes died, and in March 1880 George Eliot was married to John\r\nCross. They left St. John's Wood on the 3rd of the following December and\r\nwent to 4 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where George Eliot died on the 22nd of the\r\nsame month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCHELSEA MEMORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nComing to close quarters with it, I am not sure that, after all, Chelsea\r\nhas not more to offer the literary pilgrim than even Hampstead has.\r\nAddison, Locke, Smollett, Horace Walpole, are among the illustrious names\r\nwhose local habitations were once there but are no longer to be seen.\r\nCharles and Henry Kingsley spent their boyhood at their father's rectory\r\nin Sidney Street; Daniel Maclise lived for ten years at 4 Cheyne Walk,\r\nwhere George Eliot died; and \"Queen's House,\" No. 16 Cheyne Walk, is the\r\nhouse that, in 1862, Rossetti, Swinburne, William Michael Rossetti, and\r\nMeredith took as joint-tenants. Meredith soon paid a quarter's rent in\r\nlieu of notice and withdrew from the arrangement, but Swinburne and\r\nRossetti lived on there together for some years, and did much of their\r\ngreatest work there. Swinburne was next to go, and he presently set up\r\nhouse with Mr. Watts-Dunton at \"The Pines,\" near the foot of Putney Hill,\r\nwhere he lived till his death in 1909. In the early seventies Mr. W. M.\r\nRossetti married and removed elsewhere, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti stayed\r\non in the Chelsea house alone.\r\n\r\nLater, in the gloomy days before he went away to Birchington to die,\r\nRossetti suffered terribly from insomnia, was ill and depressed, and a\r\nprey to morbid imaginings, but in the earlier years of his tenancy of 16\r\nCheyne Walk he was absorbed in his art, his house was lively with many\r\nvisitors, and in his lazy, sociable fashion he seems to have been almost\r\nas happy as a man of his sensitive temperament could be. \"Here,\" writes\r\nMr. Joseph Knight, \"were held those meetings, prolonged often until the\r\nearly hours of the morning, which to those privileged to be present were\r\nveritable nights and feasts of gods. Here in the dimly-lighted studio,\r\naround the blazing fire, used to assemble the men of distinction or\r\npromise in literature and art whom the magnetism of Rossetti's\r\nindividuality collected around him. Here Rossetti himself used, though\r\nrarely, to read aloud, with his voice of indescribable power and\r\nclearness, and with a bell-like utterance that still dwells in the mind,\r\npassages from the poems he admired; and here, more frequently, some young\r\npoet, encouraged by his sympathy, which to all earnest effort in art was\r\noverflowing and inexhaustible, would recite his latest sonnet.\" He crowded\r\nhis rooms with quaintly-carved oak furniture, and beautiful ornaments; he\r\nhad a wonderful collection of blue china that he sometimes put on the\r\ntable and recklessly used at his dinner-parties. In his garden he had \"a\r\nmotley collection of animals, peacocks, armadilloes, the wombat,\r\nwoodchuck, or Canadian marmot, and other outlandish creatures, including\r\nthe famous zebu.\" This zebu was kept fastened to a tree, and Rossetti\r\nloved to exhibit it and point out its beauties with his maulstick. Mr.\r\nKnight goes on to repeat the story that was told concerning this animal by\r\nWhistler, who was at that time living at what is now 101 Cheyne Walk, and\r\nwas then 7 Lindsey Row. According to Whistler, one day when he and\r\nRossetti were alone in the garden, \"and Rossetti was contemplating once\r\nmore the admired possession, and pointing out with the objectionable stick\r\nthe points of special beauty, resentment blazed into indignation. By a\r\nsuper-bovine exertion the zebu tore up the roots of the tree to which it\r\nwas attached, and chased its tormentor round the garden, which was\r\nextensive enough to admit of an exciting chase round the trees.\" The zebu\r\nwas fortunately hampered by the uprooted tree, and Rossetti made good his\r\nescape, but he would harbour the animal no longer, and as nobody would buy\r\nit he gave it away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN'S HOUSE. CHEYNE WALK.]\r\n\r\nYou get an illuminating glimpse of Rossetti's home life in these days from\r\nthat useful literary chronicle, Allingham's Diary (Monday, June 27, 1864):\r\n\"Got down to Chelsea by half-past eight to D. G. R.'s. Breakfasted in a\r\nsmall, lofty room on first floor with window looking on the garden. Fanny\r\nin white. Then we went into the garden, and lay on the grass, eating\r\nstrawberries and looking at the peacock. F. went to look at the\r\n'chicking,' her plural of chicken. Then Swinburne came in and soon began\r\nto recite--a parody on Browning was one thing; and after him Whistler, who\r\ntalked about his own pictures--Royal Academy--the Chinese painter girl,\r\nMillais, &c.\"\r\n\r\nRossetti's wife had died shortly before he went to Cheyne Walk, and it was\r\nduring his residence here that her grave in Highgate Cemetery was opened,\r\nthat the manuscript volume of poems he had buried with her might be\r\nrecovered, and most of its contents included in his first published book\r\nof original work.\r\n\r\nOne time and another Whistler occupied four different houses in Cheyne\r\nWalk, and No. 101 was the first of these. He had been living in lodgings,\r\nor with his brother-in-law, since he came over from America, but in 1863\r\nhe took the Cheyne Walk house, and his mother went to live there with him.\r\nIt is a three-storey house, and the back room on the first floor was his\r\nstudio; the river lies before it, just across the road, and he could see\r\nfrom his front windows old Battersea Bridge, Battersea Church on the other\r\nside of the Thames, and at night the twinkling lights of boats and barges\r\nat anchor and the flare and many-coloured glitter of Cremorne Gardens in\r\nthe distance. At the end of Cheyne Walk lived the boatbuilder Greaves. \"He\r\nhad worked in Chelsea for years,\" write Mr. and Mrs. Pennell, in their\r\n_Life of Whistler_. \"He had rowed Turner about on the river, and his two\r\nsons were to row Whistler. One of the sons, Mr. Walter Greaves, has told\r\nus that Mrs. Booth, a big, hard, coarse Scotchwoman, was always with\r\nTurner when he came for a boat. Turner would ask Greaves what kind of a\r\nday it was going to be, and if Greaves answered 'Fine,' he would get\r\nGreaves to row them across to Battersea Church, or to the fields, now\r\nBattersea Park. If Greaves was doubtful, Turner would say, 'Well, Mrs.\r\nBooth, we won't go far'; and afterwards for the sons--boys at the\r\ntime--Turner in their memory was overshadowed by her.\" Whistler and the\r\nGreaves boys were up and down the river at all hours of the day and night\r\nand in all weathers, painting and sketching, they under his tuition, or\r\ngathering impressions and studying effects of light and shadow. He was\r\nfrequently in at the Rossettis' house, and they and their friends were as\r\nfrequently visiting him.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Whistler moved to what is now 96 Cheyne Walk, and had a\r\nhousewarming on the 5th of February at which the two Rossettis were\r\npresent. Describing the decoration of the walls here, Mr. and Mrs. Pennell\r\nsay its beauty was its simplicity. \"Rossetti's house was a museum, an\r\nantiquity shop, in comparison. The simplicity seemed the more bewildering\r\nbecause it was the growth, not of weeks but of years. The drawing-room was\r\nnot painted till the day of Whistler's first dinner-party. In the morning\r\nhe sent for the brothers Greaves to help him. 'It will never be dry in\r\ntime,' they feared. 'What matter?' said Whistler; 'it will be\r\nbeautiful!'... and by evening the walls were flushed with flesh-colour,\r\npale yellow and white spread over doors and woodwork, and we have heard\r\nthat gowns and coats too were touched with flesh-colour and yellow before\r\nthe evening was at an end. One Sunday morning Whistler, after he had taken\r\nhis mother to Chelsea Church, as he always did, again sent for his pupils\r\nand painted a great ship with spreading sails in each of the two panels at\r\nthe end of the hall; the ships are said to be still on the wall, covered\r\nup. His mother was not so pleased when, on her return, she saw the blue\r\nand white harmony, for she would have had him put away his brushes on\r\nSunday as once she put away his toys.\"\r\n\r\nSolitude was irksome to him, and he welcomed the motley crowd of artists\r\nand students who came in at all hours to chat with him whilst he worked.\r\nThe Pennells tell a capital story of a man named Barthe, of whom Whistler\r\nhad bought tapestries, and who, not being able to get his account settled,\r\ncalled one evening for the money. He was told that Whistler was not in;\r\nbut there was a cab waiting at the door, and he could hear his debtor's\r\nvoice, so he pushed past the maid and, as he afterwards related, \"Upstairs\r\nI find him, before a little picture, painting, and behind him ze bruzzers\r\nGreaves holding candles. And Vistlaire he say, 'You ze very man I vant:\r\nhold a candle!' And I hold a candle. And Vistlaire he paint, and he paint,\r\nand zen he take ze picture, and he go downstairs, and he get in ze cab,\r\nand he drive off, and we hold ze candle, and I see him no more. Mon Dieu,\r\nil est terrible, ce Vistlaire!\"\r\n\r\nHis studio here was a back room on the second floor, and up to that\r\nstudio, on many days of 1873, Carlyle climbed to give sittings for the\r\nportrait which ranks now with the greatest of Whistler's works. The\r\nportrait of his mother had already been painted in that same small room,\r\nand hung on the wall there whilst Carlyle was coming to life on the\r\ncanvas. Carlyle was not a patient sitter. Directly he sat down he urged\r\nWhistler to \"fire away,\" and was evidently anxious to get through with his\r\npart of the business as quickly as possible. \"One day,\" says Whistler, \"he\r\ntold me of others who had painted his portrait. There was Mr. Watts, a mon\r\nof note. And I went to his studio, and there was much meestification, and\r\nscreens were drawn, and I was not allowed to see anything. And then, at\r\nlast, the screens were put aside and there I was. And I looked. And Mr.\r\nWatts, a great mon, he said to me, 'How do you like it?' And then I turned\r\nto Mr. Watts, and I said, 'Mon, I would have ye know I am in the hobit of\r\nwurin' clean lunen!'\" There is a note in Allingham's Diary, dated July 29,\r\n1873: \"Carlyle tells me he is 'sitting' to Whistler. If C. makes signs\r\nof changing his position W. screams out in an agonised tone, 'For God's\r\nsake, don't move!' C. afterwards said that all W.'s anxiety seemed to be\r\nto get the _coat_ painted to ideal perfection; the face went for little.\r\nHe had begun by asking two or three sittings, but managed to get a great\r\nmany. At last C. flatly rebelled. He used to define W. as the most absurd\r\ncreature on the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHISTLER. 96 CHEYNE WALK.]\r\n\r\nWhilst he was at 96 Cheyne Walk, Whistler brought his famous libel action\r\nagainst Ruskin, won it, but was awarded only a farthing damages, and had\r\nto pay his own costs. During the progress of the suit he was having the\r\nWhite House built for him in Tite Street, Chelsea, but the payment of his\r\nlaw costs so crippled him that he had to sell it before it was ready for\r\noccupation, and to sell off also the furniture and effects of his Cheyne\r\nWalk home.\r\n\r\nNone of these things seem, however, to have affected Whistler with worse\r\nthan a temporary irritation. He wrote jestingly over his door: \"Except the\r\nLord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. E. W. Godwin,\r\nF.S.A., built this one;\" turned his back upon the scenes of his recent\r\ndisasters, and went to Venice. After rather more than a year of absence,\r\nhe returned to London in the winter of 1880, stayed with his brother in\r\nWimpole Street, put up at divers lodgings, had an exhibition in Bond\r\nStreet, and in May 1881 took a studio at 13 Tite Street, Chelsea, and\r\nbegan to be the most talked-of man of the day. \"He filled the papers with\r\nletters,\" write Mr. and Mrs. Pennell. \"London echoed with his laugh. His\r\nwhite lock stood up defiantly above his curls; his cane lengthened; a\r\nseries of collars sprang from his long overcoat; his hat had a curlier\r\nbrim, a lower tilt over his eyes; he invented amazing costumes.... He was\r\nknown to pay calls with the long bamboo stick in his hand and pink bows on\r\nhis shoes. He allowed no break in the gossip. The carriages brought\r\ncrowds, but not sitters. Few would sit to him before the trial; after it\r\nthere were fewer. In the seventies it needed courage to be painted by\r\nWhistler; now it was to risk notoriety and ridicule.\" When Mr. Pennell\r\nfirst saw him at 13 Tite Street, in July 1884, \"he was all in white, his\r\nwaistcoat had long sleeves, and every minute it seemed as if he must begin\r\nto juggle with glasses. For, to be honest, my first impression was of a\r\nbar-keeper strayed from a Philadelphia saloon into a Chelsea studio. Never\r\nhad I seen such thick, black, curling hair. But in the midst was the white\r\nlock, and keen, brilliant eyes flashed at me from under the thick, bushy\r\neyebrows.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Tite Street, Whistler presently removed to 454 Fulham Road; thence to\r\nThe Vale, Chelsea, a pleasant quarter which was a year or two ago wiped\r\noff the face of the earth; and in 1890 he was back again in Cheyne Walk,\r\nat No. 21. \"I remember a striking remark of Whistler's at a garden-party\r\nin his Chelsea house,\" says M. Gerard Harry, who was one of Whistler's\r\nguests at No. 21. \"As he caught me observing some incompletely furnished\r\nrooms and questioning within myself whether he had occupied the house more\r\nthan a fortnight or so: 'You see,' he said, with his short laugh, 'I do\r\nnot care for definitely settling down anywhere. Where there is no more\r\nspace for improvement, or dreaming about improvement, where mystery is in\r\nperfect shape, it is _finis_--the end--death. There is no hope nor outlook\r\nleft.' I do not vouch for the words, but that was certainly the sense of a\r\nremark which struck me as offering a key to much of Whistler's philosophy,\r\nand to one aspect of his original art.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1892, in spite of himself and his fantastic and silly posings and\r\nposturings, the world had learned to take his art seriously instead of\r\ntaking him so, and when he went away that year to live in Paris his\r\ngreatness as a painter had become pretty generally recognised. In 1894 he\r\ncame back to London with his wife, who was dying of cancer, and after her\r\ndeath in 1896 he lived with friends or in lodgings, and had no settled\r\nhome, until in 1902 he once again took a house in Cheyne Walk, this time\r\nNo. 74, a house which stands below the street level; its front windows\r\noverlook the Thames, and it had a large studio at the back. Here Mrs. and\r\nMiss Birnie Philip went to share house with him, for his health was\r\nbreaking, and he was in need of companionship and attention. But there\r\nwere good intervals, when he was able to work with all his old eagerness\r\nand energy. \"We knew on seeing him when he was not so well,\" say Mr. and\r\nMrs. Pennell, \"for his costume of invalid remained original. He clung to a\r\nfur-lined overcoat worn into shabbiness. In his younger years he had\r\nobjected to a dressing-gown as an unmanly concession; apparently he had\r\nnot outgrown the objection, and on his bad days this shabby, worn-out\r\novercoat was its substitute. Nor did the studio seem the most comfortable\r\nplace for a man so ill as he was. It was bare, with little furniture, as\r\nhis studios always were, and he had not used it enough to give it the air\r\nof a workshop. The whole house showed that illness was reigning there.\"\r\nTrays and odds and ends of the sickroom lay about the hall; papers, books,\r\nand miscellaneous litter made the drawing-room and dining-room look\r\ndisorderly. \"When we saw Whistler in his big, shabby overcoat shuffling\r\nabout the huge studio, he struck us as so old, so feeble and fragile, that\r\nwe could imagine no sadder or more tragic figure. It was the more tragic\r\nbecause he had always been such a dandy, a word he would have been the\r\nfirst to use in reference to himself.... No one would have suspected the\r\ndandy in this forlorn little old man, wrapped in a worn overcoat, hardly\r\nable to walk.\"\r\n\r\nHe lingered thus for about a year; then the end came suddenly. On the 14th\r\nJuly 1903, Mrs. Pennell found him dressed and in his studio. \"He seemed\r\nbetter, though his face was sunken, and in his eyes was that terrible\r\nvagueness. Now he talked, and a touch of gallantry was in his greeting, 'I\r\nwish I felt as well as you look.' He asked about Henley, the news of whose\r\ndeath had come a day or two before.... There was a return of vigour in his\r\nvoice when Miss Birnie Philip brought him a cup of chicken broth, and he\r\ncried, 'Take the damned thing away,' and his old charm was in the apology\r\nthat followed, but, he said, if he ate every half-hour or so, as the\r\ndoctor wanted, how could he be expected to have an appetite for dinner? He\r\ndozed a little, but woke up quickly with a show of interest in\r\neverything.\" But on the evening of the 17th, he suddenly collapsed, and\r\nwas dead before the doctor could be fetched to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURNER'S HOUSE. CHEYNE WALK.]\r\n\r\nTurner's last days in this same Cheyne Walk were almost as sad, almost\r\nas piteous as Whistler's, but there is a haze of mystery about them, as\r\nthere is about some of his paintings, and he had no butterfly past of\r\ndandyism to contrast painfully with the squalor of his ending. Born over\r\nthe barber's shop kept by his father in Maiden Lane, Strand, he mounted to\r\nthe seats of the immortals without acquiring by the way any taste for\r\npersonal adornment, or for the elegancies or little prettinesses so\r\nbeloved by little artists in his home surroundings. His soul was like a\r\nstar, and could not make its heaven among the dainty chairs and tables and\r\nnice wall and mantelpiece ornaments of the drawing-room. On Stothard's\r\nadvice (Stothard being one of the customers at the shaving shop) Turner's\r\nfather made him an artist; he studied under Sir Joshua Reynolds, and\r\nlater, Blake was one of his pupils. Growing in reputation, he lived by\r\nturns in Harley Street, at Hammersmith, at Twickenham, and is described in\r\nmiddle age as bluff and rough-mannered, and looking \"the very moral of a\r\nmaster carpenter, with lobster-red face, twinkling staring grey eyes,\r\nwhite tie, blue coat with brass buttons, crab-shell turned-up boots, large\r\nfluffy hat, and enormous umbrella.\" From about 1815 onwards, he had a\r\nhouse that is no longer standing at 47 Queen Anne Street, Harley Street,\r\nand here, in 1843, when Turner was sixty-eight, a Mr. Hammersley called on\r\nhim and has described (I quote from Mr. Lewis Hind's _Turner's Golden\r\nVisions_) how he \"heard the shambling, slippered footstep coming down the\r\nstairs, the cold, cheerless room, the gallery, even less tidy and more\r\nforlorn, all confusion, mouldiness, and wretched litter; most of the\r\npictures covered with uncleanly sheets, and the man! his loose dress, his\r\nragged hair, his indifferent quiet--all, indeed, that went to make his\r\nphysique and some of his mind; but above all I saw, felt (and feel still)\r\nhis penetrating grey eye.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere between 1847 and 1848 Turner strangely disappeared from his\r\ncustomary haunts; his Queen Anne Street house was closed, the door kept\r\nlocked, and his old housekeeper, Hannah Danby, could only assure anybody\r\nwho came that he was not there, and that she simply did not know where he\r\nhad gone. For the next four years or so, until he was dying, no one\r\nsucceeded in discovering his hiding-place. Now and then, in the meantime,\r\nhe would appear in a friend's studio, or would be met with at one of the\r\nGalleries, but he offered no explanation of his curious behaviour, and\r\nallowed no one to obtain any clue to his whereabouts. He went in 1850 to a\r\ndinner given by David Roberts, and was in good spirits, and bubbling over\r\nwith laborious jokes. \"Turner afterwards, in Roberts's absence, took the\r\nchair, and, at Stanfield's request, proposed Roberts's health, which he\r\ndid, speaking hurriedly, but soon ran short of words and breath, and\r\ndropped down on his chair with a hearty laugh, starting up again and\r\nfinishing with a 'Hip, hip, hurrah!'... Turner was the last who left, and\r\nRoberts accompanied him along the street to hail a cab. When the cab drove\r\nup, he assisted Turner to his seat, shut the door, and asked where he\r\nshould tell cabby to take him; but Turner was not to be caught, and, with\r\na knowing wink, replied, 'Tell him to drive to Oxford Street, and then\r\nI'll direct him where to go.'\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is he was living at Cremorne Cottage, 119 Cheyne Walk. He was\r\nliving there anonymously; a Mrs. Booth, whom he had known many years\r\nbefore when he stayed at her Margate boarding-house, was keeping house for\r\nhim, and he was known in the neighbourhood as Admiral Booth, a rumour\r\nhaving got about that he was a retired naval officer fallen on evil days.\r\nThis was the time of which the father of the Greaves boys had spoken to\r\nWhistler--the days when Mrs. Booth used to come with Turner to the\r\nwaterside and he would row them over to Battersea. Though all his greatest\r\nwork was finished, Turner painted several pictures here; he frequently\r\nrose at daybreak, and, wrapped in a blanket or a dressing-gown, stood out\r\non the roof, leaning over the railing to watch the sunrise and the play of\r\nlight on the river opposite. He used the room on the second floor as his\r\nstudio, and in that room, on the 19th December 1851, he died. Some months\r\nbefore his death, he was seen at the Royal Academy's private view; then,\r\ntardily responding to a letter of friendly reproach that David Roberts had\r\naddressed to him at Queen Anne Street, he came to Roberts's studio in\r\nFitzroy Square. He was \"broken and ailing,\" and had been touched by\r\nRoberts's appeal, but as for disclosing his residence--\"You must not ask\r\nme,\" he said; \"but whenever I come to town I will always come to see you.\"\r\nWhen Roberts tried to cheer him, he laid his hand on his heart and\r\nmurmured, \"No, no! There is something here that is all wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHis illness increasing on him, he wrote to Margate for Dr. Price, an old\r\nacquaintance of his and Mrs. Booth's, and Price, coming up, examined him\r\nand told him there was no hope of his recovery. \"Go downstairs,\" he urged\r\nthe doctor, \"take a glass of sherry, and then look at me again.\" But a\r\nsecond examination only confirmed Dr. Price in his opinion.\r\n\r\nIt must have been at this juncture that Turner's hiding-place was\r\ndiscovered. His Queen Anne Street housekeeper, Hannah Danby, found a\r\nletter left in the pocket of one of his old coats, and this gave the\r\nChelsea address. She went with another woman and made inquiries round\r\nabout Cheyne Walk till it was clear enough to her that the Mr. Booth to\r\nwhom that letter was directed was none other than Turner, and acting on\r\nher information Mr. Harpur, Turner's executor, journeyed at once to\r\nChelsea, and arrived at 119 Cheyne Walk to find Turner sinking fast.\r\nTowards sunset, on that wintry day of his dying, he asked Mrs. Booth to\r\nwheel him to the window, and so gazing out on the wonder of the darkening\r\nsky he passed quietly away with his head on her shoulder.\r\n\r\nA certain John Pye, a Chelsea engraver, afterwards interviewed the owner\r\nof No. 119, and learned from him that Turner and Mrs. Booth had, some four\r\nor five years before, called and taken the house of him, paying their rent\r\nin advance because they objected to giving any names or references. Pye\r\nalso saw Mrs. Booth, and says she was a woman of fifty, illiterate, but\r\n\"good-looking and kindly-mannered.\" Turner had used to call her \"old 'un,\"\r\nshe said, and she called him \"dear\"; and she explained that she had first\r\ngot acquainted with him when, more than twenty years ago, \"he became her\r\nlodger near the Custom House at Margate.\" So small was the shabby little\r\nhouse in Cheyne Walk that the undertakers were unable to carry the coffin\r\nup the narrow staircase, and had to carry the body down to it. Nowadays,\r\nthe house has been enlarged; it and the house next door have been thrown\r\ninto one, otherwise it has undergone little change since Turner knew it.\r\n\r\nWhilst Turner was thus passing out of life in Cheyne Walk, Carlyle was\r\ndwelling near by at No. 24 (then No. 5) Cheyne Row, and had been resident\r\nthere for seventeen years. On first coming to London in 1830, he and his\r\nwife lodged at 33 Ampton Street, Gray's Inn Road. They spent, he says, \"an\r\ninteresting, cheery, and, in spite of poor arrangements, really pleasant\r\nwinter\" there; they had a \"clean and decent pair of rooms,\" and their\r\nlandlord's family consisted of \"quiet, decent people.\" He wrote his essay\r\non Dr. Johnson whilst he was here, and was making a fruitless search for a\r\npublisher who would accept _Sartor Resartus_, which he had recently\r\ncompleted. Jeffrey called there several times to pass an afternoon with\r\nhim, and John Stuart Mill was one other of the many visitors who found\r\ntheir way to the drab, unlovely, rather shabby street to chat with the\r\ndour, middle-aged Scotch philosopher, who was only just beginning to be\r\nheard of.\r\n\r\nHe fixed on the Cheyne Row house in 1834, and, except for occasional\r\nholidays, never left it until his death forty-seven years afterwards. As\r\nsoon as he was settled here Carlyle wrote to Sir William Hamilton, giving\r\nhim his new address: \"Our upholsterers, with all their rubbish and\r\nclippings, are at length swept handsomely out of doors. I have got my\r\nlittle book-press set up, my table fixed firm in its place, and sit here\r\nawaiting what Time and I, in our questionable wrestle, shall make out\r\nbetween us.\" In another letter of about the same date he writes of it:\r\n\"The street is flag-paved, sunk-storied, iron-railed, all old-fashioned\r\nand tightly done up, looks out on a rank of sturdy old pollarded (that is,\r\nbeheaded) lime trees standing there like giants in tawtie wigs (for the\r\nnew boughs are still young); beyond this a high brick wall; backwards a\r\ngarden, the size of our back one at Comely Bank, with trees, &c., in bad\r\nculture; beyond this green hayfields and tree avenues, once a bishop's\r\npleasure grounds, an unpicturesque but rather cheerful outlook. The house\r\nitself is eminent, antique, wainscoted to the very ceiling, and has been\r\nall new painted and repaired; broadish stair, with massive balustrade (in\r\nthe old style), corniced and as thick as one's thigh; floors thick as\r\nrock, wood of them here and there worm-eaten, yet capable of cleanliness,\r\nand still with thrice the strength of a modern floor. Chelsea is a\r\nsingular heterogeneous kind of spot, very dirty and confused in some\r\nplaces, quite beautiful in others, abounding in antiquities and the traces\r\nof great men--Sir Thomas More, Steele, Smollett, &c. Our Row, which for\r\nthe last three doors or so is a street and none of the noblest, runs out\r\nupon a Parade (perhaps they call it) running along the shore of the river,\r\na broad highway with huge shady trees, boats lying moored, and a smell of\r\nshipping and tar.\"\r\n\r\nA note in Allingham's Diary (1860) offers you a very clear little picture\r\nof Carlyle's garden here, as he saw it: \"In Carlyle's garden, some twenty\r\nyards by six; ivy at the end. Three or four lilac bushes; an ash stands on\r\nyour left; a little copper beech on your right gives just an umbrella to\r\nsit under when the sun is hot; a vine or two on one wall, neighboured\r\nby a jasmine--one pear tree.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARLYLE. AMPTON STREET.]\r\n\r\nIn this Cheyne Row house Carlyle wrote all his books, except _Sartor_ and\r\nsome of the miscellaneous essays; here he entertained, not always very\r\nwillingly or very graciously, most of the great men of his day; quarrelled\r\nwith his neighbours furiously over the crowing of their cocks; was\r\npestered by uninvited, admiring callers from all over the world; and had\r\nhis room on the top floor furnished with double-windows that were supposed\r\nto render it sound-proof, but did not. Charles Boner, visiting 24 Cheyne\r\nRow in 1862, disturbed Carlyle as he sat in his dressing-gown and slippers\r\ncorrecting the proofs of his _Frederick the Great_, whilst Mrs. Carlyle\r\nremained in attendance, seated on a sofa by the fire.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Mrs. Carlyle died suddenly of heart failure, and left him burdened\r\nwith remorse that he had not been kinder to her and made her life happier;\r\nand after two years of lonely living without her, he writes: \"I am very\r\nidle here, very solitary, which I find to be oftenest less miserable to me\r\nthan the common society that offers. Except Froude almost alone, whom I\r\nsee once a week, there is hardly anybody whose talk, always polite, clear,\r\nsharp, and sincere, does me any considerable good.... I am too weak, too\r\nlanguid, too sad of heart, too unfit for any work, in fact, to care\r\nsufficiently for any object left me in the world to think of grappling\r\nround it and coercing it by work. A most sorry dog-kennel it oftenest all\r\nseems to me, and wise words, if one ever had them, to be only thrown away\r\non it. Basta-basta, I for most part say of it, and look with longings\r\ntowards the still country where at last we and our loved ones shall be\r\ntogether again.\"\r\n\r\nYou will get no better or more intimate glimpses into Carlyle's home life\r\nthan Allingham gives in his Diary. Sometimes they are merely casual and\r\nscrappy notes, at others fairly full records of his walks and talks with\r\nhim, such as this: \"_1873, April 28._--At Carlyle's house about three. He\r\nspent about fifteen minutes in trying to clear the stem of a long clay\r\npipe with a brass wire, and in the end did not succeed. The pipe was new,\r\nbut somehow obstructed. At last he sent for another one and smoked, and we\r\ngot out at last. (I never saw him smoke in public.) He said Emerson had\r\ncalled on him on Sunday, and he meant to visit E. to-day at his lodging in\r\nDown Street. We walked to Hyde Park by Queen's Gate, and westward along\r\nthe broad walk, next to the ride, with the Serpentine a field distant on\r\nthe left hand. This was a favourite route of his. I was well content to\r\nhave the expectation of seeing Emerson again, and, moreover, Emerson and\r\nCarlyle together. We spoke of Masson's _Life of Milton_, a volume of which\r\nwas on C.'s table. He said Masson's praise of Milton was exaggerated.\r\n'Milton had a gift in poetry--of a particular kind. _Paradise Lost_ is\r\nabsurd; I never could take to it all--though now and again clouds of\r\nsplendour rolled in upon the scene.'... At Hyde Park Corner, C. stopped\r\nand looked at the clock. 'You are going to Down Street, sir?' 'No, it's\r\ntoo late.' 'The place is close at hand.' 'No, no, it's half-past five.' So\r\nhe headed for Knightsbridge, and soon after I helped him into a Chelsea\r\nomnibus, banning internally the clay pipe (value a halfpenny farthing)\r\nthrough which this chance (perhaps the last, for Emerson is going away\r\nsoon) was lost.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS CARLYLE]\r\n\r\nThere are numerous entries in the Diary of visits and conversations of\r\nthis sort. On October 18, 1879, Allingham called at Cheyne Row with his\r\nlittle son, and they met Carlyle coming out of the door to his carriage.\r\nOn December 4, of the same year: \"Helen and I to Cheyne Row. Carlyle's\r\neighty-fourth birthday. Mrs. Lecky there. Browning and Ruskin are gone. C.\r\non his sofa by the window, warm and quiet, wearing a new purple and gold\r\ncap. Gifts of flowers on the table....\" Some of the swift little\r\nword-sketches of Carlyle at this date, when he was very old, very feeble,\r\nand apt to be oppressed with gloom, are piteous and pathetic enough. On\r\nhis eighty-fifth birthday (December 4, 1880) Allingham found him easier\r\nand more himself; but on Friday, December 24, you read: \"To Carlyle's at\r\ntwo. He was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room. When I spoke to him he\r\nheld out his hand and shook hands with me, but said nothing. I was not\r\nsure that he knew me. A stout Scotch servant girl and I lifted him to his\r\nfeet to go to the carriage. In the hall his heavy sealskin coat was put on\r\nwith difficulty, and he was got into the carriage. Alick and I with him.\r\nWe drove twice round Hyde Park. The old man dozed much.\"\r\n\r\nEarlier that year, the two sons of Alexander Munro called at Cheyne Row,\r\nand in a letter home the elder of them gave a wonderfully poignant and\r\nliving account of their visit. Munro, who was dead, had been one of\r\nCarlyle's old friends, and the two boys were now at school at the\r\nCharterhouse. They were conducted upstairs, says the letter, to a\r\nwell-lighted, cheerful apartment, and here \"the maid went forward and said\r\nsomething to Carlyle, and left the room. He was sitting before a fire in\r\nan arm-chair, propped up with pillows, with his feet on a stool, and\r\nlooked much older than I had expected. The lower part of his face was\r\ncovered with a rather shaggy beard, almost quite white. His eyes were\r\nbright blue, but looked filmy from age. He had on a sort of coloured\r\nnightcap, and a long gown reaching to his ankles, and slippers on his\r\nfeet. A rest attached to the arm of his chair supported a book before him.\r\nI could not quite see the name, but I think it was Channing's works.\r\nLeaning against the fireplace was a long clay pipe, and there was a slight\r\nsmell of tobacco in the room. We advanced and shook hands, and he invited\r\nus to sit down, and began, I think, by asking where we were living. He\r\ntalked of our father affectionately, speaking in a low tone as if to\r\nhimself, and stopping now and then for a moment and sighing.... He went\r\non, 'I am near the end of my course, and the sooner the better is my own\r\nfeeling.' He said he still reads a little, but has not many books he cares\r\nto read now, and is 'continually disturbed by foolish interruptions from\r\npeople who do not know the value of an old man's leisure.' His hands were\r\nvery thin and wasted; he showed us how they shook and trembled unless he\r\nrested them on something, and said they were failing him from weakness.\"\r\nAnd, at length, closing the interview, \"'Well, I'll just bid you\r\ngood-bye.' We shook hands. He asked our names. He could not quite hear\r\nHenry's at first. 'I am a little deaf, but I can hear well enough\r\ntalking,' or words to that effect. 'I wish you God's blessing;\r\ngood-bye.' We shook hands once more and went away. I was not at all shy.\r\nHe seemed such a venerable old man, and so worn and old-looking, that I\r\nwas very much affected. Our visit was on Tuesday, May 18, 1880, at about 2\r\nP.M.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARLYLE'S HOUSE. CHEYNE ROW.]\r\n\r\nHe died in the following February; after lying motionless and seemingly\r\nunconscious for hours, he passed quietly soon after eight on the morning\r\nof February 5, 1881. His bed, says Allingham, had been brought down to the\r\ndrawing-room (the front room on the first floor), and he rarely spoke in\r\nthe last two or three weeks, not so much because he could not as because\r\nhe did not seem to wish to say anything. Newspaper reporters were so\r\ncontinually ringing at the door, day and night, that bulletins had to be\r\nposted outside to prevent this. Now and then he appeared to wander in his\r\nmind, and when the Scotch maid, Mary, was attending upon him he would\r\nsometimes murmur, \"Poor little woman,\" as if he mistook her for his\r\nlong-dead Jenny; and once, says Allingham, \"he supposed the female hands\r\nthat tended him, lifting his head, perhaps, to be those of his good old\r\nmother--'Ah, mother, is it you?' he murmured, or some such words. I think\r\nit was on the day before the last day that Mary heard him saying to\r\nhimself, 'So this is Death: well----'\"\r\n\r\nBut the Cheyne Row house has many happy memories too, and I always think\r\none of the happiest is that of how Leigh Hunt called once after a long\r\nabsence, and brought with him word of some unexpected good news that so\r\ndelighted Mrs. Carlyle that she impulsively ran to him and kissed him,\r\nand he went away to write that charming little rondeau that bids fair to\r\noutlive all his more ambitious poetry:\r\n\r\n  \"Jenny kissed me when we met,\r\n     Jumping from the chair she sat in;\r\n   Time, you thief, who love to get\r\n     Sweets into your list, put that in:\r\n   Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,\r\n     Say that health and wealth have missed me,\r\n   Say I'm growing old--but add,\r\n     Jenny kissed me.\"\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt was turned fifty then, and was Carlyle's neighbour, living at\r\nNo. 10 (then No. 4) Upper Cheyne Row. I have seen it said that Leigh Hunt\r\nwent there in order to be near Carlyle, but his occupancy of that house\r\ndates from 1833--the year before Carlyle established himself in\r\nChelsea--and he remained there until 1840, seven years of poverty and\r\nworry, when it was literal truth that he was weary and sad, in indifferent\r\nhealth, harassed for want of money, and growing old, yet you find him\r\nnever losing hope, and always ready on the smallest excuse to rejoice and\r\nmake light of his troubles. I am afraid Dickens's caricature of Hunt as\r\nHarold Skimpole, and Byron's contemptuous references to his vanity and\r\nvulgarity and the squalor of his easy-going home life (his children, said\r\nByron, \"are dirtier and more mischievous than Yahoos,\" and writing of\r\ntheir arrival in Italy as Shelley's guests he observes, \"Poor Hunt, with\r\nhis six little blackguards, are coming slowly up; as usual he turned back\r\nonce--was there ever such a kraal out of the Hottentot country?\")--I am\r\nrather afraid these things have tended to wrong Hunt in our imagination of\r\nhim, for you learn on other evidence that there is just enough truth in\r\nthose representations of him to make them seem quite true, and they linger\r\nin your mind, and affect your regard and admiration of the man in spite of\r\nyourself. But Dickens, with his keen sense of the absurd, had a habit of\r\nexaggeration; there was no ill-nature in his laughter--he merely seized on\r\ncertain of Hunt's weaknesses and gave them to a character who has none of\r\nHunt's finer qualities, and it is ridiculous in us and unfair to both men\r\nto take that caricature as a portrait. As for Byron--he could not justly\r\nappraise Hunt, for he had no means of understanding him. His own way of\r\nlife was made too easy for him from the first; he was not born to Hunt's\r\ndifficulties and disadvantages; his experiences of the world, and\r\ntherefore his sympathies, were too limited. There is no merit in living\r\nelegantly and playing the gentleman when you simply inherit, as the fruits\r\nof an ancestor's abilities, all the conveniences and the money that enable\r\nyou to do so. On the whole, if you compare their lives, you will realise\r\nthat Leigh Hunt was by far the greater man of the two, even if Byron was\r\nthe greater poet, and I am more than a little inclined to agree with\r\nCharles Lamb that even as a poet Byron was \"great in so little a way. To\r\nbe a poet is to be the man, not a petty portion of occasional low passion\r\nworked up in a permanent form of humanity. Shakespeare has thrust such\r\nrubbishy feelings into a corner--the dark, dusty heart of Don John, in the\r\n_Much Ado about Nothing_.\"\r\n\r\nShelley never speaks of Leigh Hunt but in the kindliest terms. He was\r\n\"gentle, honourable, innocent, and brave,\" writes Shelley; \"one of more\r\nexalted toleration for all who do and think evil, and yet himself more\r\nfree from evil; one of simpler and, in the highest sense of the word,\r\npurer life and manners, I never knew.\" He is, he says in the _Letter to\r\nMaria Gisborne_:\r\n\r\n                      \"One of those happy souls\r\n  Which are the salt of the earth, and without whom\r\n  This earth would smell like what it is--a tomb.\"\r\n\r\nHunt tells in his _Autobiography_ how he came to Chelsea, and gives a\r\nglowing description of his house there. He left St. John's Wood, and then\r\nhis home in the New Road (now Marylebone Road), because he found the clay\r\nsoil of the one and the lack of quiet around the other affected his\r\nhealth, or \"perhaps it was only the melancholy state of our fortune\" that\r\nwas answerable for that result; anyhow, from the noise and dust of the New\r\nRoad he removed to Upper Cheyne Row--\"to a corner in Chelsea,\" as he says,\r\n\"where the air of the neighbouring river was so refreshing and the quiet\r\nof the 'no-thoroughfare' so full of repose, that although our fortunes\r\nwere at their worst, and my health almost at a piece with them, I felt for\r\nsome weeks as if I could sit still for ever, embalmed in silence. I got to\r\nlike the very cries in the street, for making me the more aware of it by\r\nthe contrast. I fancied they were unlike the cries in other quarters of\r\nthe suburbs, and that they retained something of the old quaintness and\r\nmelodiousness which procured them the reputation of having been composed\r\nby Purcell and others.... There was an old seller of fish, in particular,\r\nwhose cry of 'Shrimps as large as prawns' was such a regular, long-drawn,\r\nand truly pleasing melody that, in spite of his hoarse and, I am\r\nafraid, drunken voice, I used to wish for it of an evening, and hail it\r\nwhen it came....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEIGH HUNT'S HOUSE. CHELSEA.]\r\n\r\n\"I know not whether the corner I speak of remains as quiet as it was. I am\r\nafraid not; for steamboats have carried vicissitude into Chelsea, and\r\nBelgravia threatens it with her mighty advent. But to complete my sense of\r\nrepose and distance, the house was of that old-fashioned sort which I have\r\nalways loved best, familiar to the eyes of my parents, and associated with\r\nchildhood. It had seats in the windows, a small third room on the first\r\nfloor, of which I made a sanctum, into which no perturbation was to enter,\r\nexcept to calm itself with religious and cheerful thoughts; and there were\r\na few limes in front which, in their due season, diffused a fragrance. In\r\nthis house we remained seven years; in the course of which, besides\r\ncontributing some articles to the _Edinburgh_ and _Westminster Reviews_,\r\nand producing a good deal of the book since called _The Town_, I set up\r\n(in 1834) the _London Journal_, endeavoured to continue the _Monthly\r\nRepository_, and wrote the poem entitled _Captain Sword and Captain Pen_,\r\nthe _Legend of Florence_, and three other plays. Here also I became\r\nacquainted with Thomas Carlyle, one of the kindest and best, as well as\r\nmost eloquent of men.... I believe that what Mr. Carlyle loves better than\r\nhis fault-finding, with all its eloquence, is the face of any human\r\ncreature that looks suffering, and loving, and sincere; and I believe\r\nfurther that if the fellow-creature were suffering only, and neither\r\nloving nor sincere, but had come to a pass of agony in this life which put\r\nhim at the mercies of some good man for some last help and consolation\r\ntowards his grave, even at the risk of loss to repute and a sure amount\r\nof pain and vexation, that man, if the groan reached him in its\r\nforlornness, would be Thomas Carlyle.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote that from his personal experience of Carlyle, for whilst they\r\nwere neighbours at Chelsea they frequently visited each other; and\r\nCarlyle, on his part, saw the worst as well as the best of him, from the\r\ninside, and was too large-minded and too big a man to judge him by his\r\nfaults and follies only. He saw how Hunt worked, all the while haunted by\r\npecuniary distresses; unpaid tradesmen knocking at his door and worrying\r\nfor their debts; once an execution in the house; now and then faced with\r\nthe humiliation of having to ask for loans of a few shillings to buy the\r\nfamily dinner; his children almost in rags, and himself, as he said\r\nbitterly, slighted and neglected by editors and the public, and\r\n\"carelessly, over-familiarly, or even superciliously treated, pitied or\r\npatronised by his inferiors.\" Carlyle had known poverty and neglect\r\nhimself; he was fitted to judge Hunt understandingly, and he judged him\r\njustly. \"Leigh Hunt was a fine kind of man,\" he told Allingham in 1868.\r\n\"Some used to talk of him as a frivolous fellow, but when I saw him I\r\nfound he had a face as serious as death.\" In his Diary he noted, \"Hunt is\r\nalways ready to go and walk with me, or sit and talk with me to all\r\nlengths if I want him. He comes in once a week (when invited, for he is\r\nvery modest), takes a cup of tea, and sits discoursing in his brisk,\r\nfanciful way till supper time, and then cheerfully eats a cup of porridge\r\n(to sugar only), which he praises to the skies, and vows he will make his\r\nsupper of it at home.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Carlyle who was severe about the Hunts' untidy and uncleanly\r\nhousehold, and complained of the domestic utensils they borrowed and\r\nfailed to return, but Carlyle took the position in a more genial spirit,\r\nand saw the pity of it and the humour of it also. \"Hunt's house,\" he wrote\r\nafter one of his visits to No. 10 Upper Cheyne Row, \"excels all you have\r\never read of--a poetical Tinkerdom without parallel even in literature. In\r\nhis family room, where are a sickly, large wife and a whole school of\r\nwell-conditioned wild children, you will find half-a-dozen old rickety\r\nchairs gathered from half-a-dozen different hucksters, and all seemingly\r\nengaged, and just pausing, in a violent hornpipe. On these and around them\r\nand over the dusty table and ragged carpet lie all kinds of litter--books,\r\npapers, egg-shells, scissors, and last night when I was there the torn\r\nheart of a quartern loaf. His own room above stairs, into which alone I\r\nstrive to enter, he keeps cleaner. It has only two chairs, a bookcase, and\r\na writing-table; yet the noble Hunt receives you in his Tinkerdom in the\r\nspirit of a king, apologises for nothing, places you in the best seat,\r\ntakes a window-sill himself if there is no other, and then folding closer\r\nhis loose-flowing 'muslin cloud' of a printed nightgown in which he always\r\nwrites, commences the liveliest dialogue on philosophy and the prospects\r\nof man (who is to be beyond measure 'happy' yet); which again he will\r\ncourteously terminate the moment you are bound to go. A most interesting,\r\npitiable, lovable man, to be used kindly, but with discretion.\"\r\n\r\nHunt departed from Chelsea, with all his anxieties, in 1840, and took up\r\nresidence at 32 Edwardes Square, Kensington, where he got through with a\r\ngreat deal of work, and one way and another was secured at last above his\r\nfinancial embarrassments. Dickens, Jerrold, Forster and some other friends\r\nraised \u00a3900 for him by a benefit performance of _Every Man in his Humour_;\r\nthe Government granted him two sums of \u00a3200, and then a Civil List Pension\r\nof \u00a3200 a year, to the obtaining of which Carlyle readily lent all his\r\ninfluence. Moreover, the Shelley family settled an annuity of \u00a3120 upon\r\nhim. But, with all these material advantages, came the death of his wife\r\nand one of his sons. \"She was as uncomplaining during the worst storms of\r\nour adversity,\" Hunt wrote of his wife, reminiscently, \"as she was during\r\nthose at sea in our Italian voyage.\"\r\n\r\nHe was an old and rather solitary man when he moved from Kensington in\r\n1853 and went to 7 Cornwall Road, now known as 16 Rowan Road, Hammersmith\r\nRoad, but he had an ample and sure income, and was no longer haunted by\r\nduns, if he could not indulge in much in the way of luxury. When Nathaniel\r\nHawthorne was in England he went to see him at Hammersmith, and found the\r\nhouse in Rowan Road plain, small, shabby, Hunt's little study cheaply\r\npapered, sparely carpeted, and furnished meanly, and Hunt himself \"a\r\nbeautiful and venerable old man, buttoned to the chin in a black dress\r\ncoat, tall and slender, with a countenance quietly alive all over, and the\r\ngentlest and most naturally courteous manner.\" At Rowan Road he wrote most\r\nof his _Old Court Suburb_, in the preface to a recent edition of which Mr.\r\nAustin Dobson says of the Leigh Hunt of those closing days, \"He was still\r\nthe old sensitive, luminous-eyed Leigh Hunt of the wide collar and\r\nfloating printed nightgown, delighted with a flower or a bird or a\r\nbutterfly; but Time had snowed upon his pericranium, and to his breezy\r\n_robe de chambre_ he had added, or was about to add, a protective cape,\r\nmore or less ample, of faded black silk, which gave him the air (says John\r\nForster) of an old French Abb\u00e9.\" He died away from home in 1859, whilst he\r\nwas on a short visit to a relative at Putney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEIGH HUNT. 16 ROWAN ROAD. HAMMERSMITH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other literary Londoner has taken root as Carlyle did in Cheyne Row and\r\nremained for nearly half a century without once changing his address.\r\nThackeray shifted about from place to place nearly as much as most of\r\nthem. He went to school at the Charterhouse, and for a year or two had\r\nlodgings over a shop in Wilderness Row, Clerkenwell; in the first years\r\nafter his marriage he lived in Albion Street; he had chambers in the\r\nTemple, at Hare Court, in Crown Office Row, and at Brick Court. _The Paris\r\nSketch Book_ was written whilst he was living at 13 Great Coram Street, in\r\n1840, and it was there that his wife began to suffer from the sad mental\r\ndisorder that was presently to take her from him for the rest of his days.\r\nIn August 1846 he gave up his lodgings in St. James's Chambers, and drew\r\nhis broken home life together again at 16 Young Street, Kensington. \"I am\r\nbeginning to count the days now till you come,\" he wrote to his mother,\r\nwith whom his two little daughters were staying in Paris; \"and I have got\r\nthe rooms all ready in the rough, all but a couple of bedsteads, and a few\r\netceteras, which fall into their place in a day or two. As usual, I am\r\nfull of business and racket, working every day, and yet not advancing\r\nsomehow.\" He was industriously turning out drawings and jokes and\r\narticles and verses for _Punch_ and _Fraser's Magazine_, and hard at work\r\non the great novel that was to make him famous--_Vanity Fair_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHARTERHOUSE. FROM THE SQUARE.]\r\n\r\n\"It was not till late in the autumn that we came to live with my father in\r\nKensington,\" writes Lady Ritchie, in one of her delightful prefaces to the\r\nCentenary Edition of Thackeray's works. \"We had been at Paris with our\r\ngrandparents--while he was at work in London. It was a dark, wintry\r\nevening. The fires were lighted, the servants were engaged, Eliza--what\r\nfamily would be complete without its Eliza?--was in waiting to show us our\r\nrooms. He was away; he had not expected us so early. We saw the\r\ndrawing-room, the empty study; there was the feeling of London--London\r\nsmelt of tobacco, we thought; we stared out through the uncurtained\r\nwindows at the dark garden behind; and then, climbing the stairs, we\r\nlooked in at his bedroom door, and came to our own rooms above it.... Once\r\nmore, after his first happy married years, my father had a home and a\r\nfamily--if a house, two young children, three servants, and a little black\r\ncat can be called a family. My grandmother, who had brought us over to\r\nEngland, returned to her husband in Paris; but her mother, an old lady\r\nwrapped in Indian shawls, presently came to live with us, and divided her\r\ntime between Kensington and the Champs Elysees until 1848, when she died\r\nat Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThackeray's first name for _Vanity Fair_ was _Pencil Sketches of English\r\nSociety_. He offered the opening chapters of it under that title to\r\nColburn for his _New Monthly Magazine_. Thereafter he seems to have\r\nreshaped the novel and renamed it, and even then had difficulty to find a\r\npublisher. At length, Messrs. Bradbury & Evans accepted it, and it was\r\narranged that it should be published after the manner that Dickens had\r\nalready rendered popular--in monthly parts; and the first part duly\r\nappeared on the 1st January 1847, in the familiar yellow wrappers that\r\nserved to distinguish Thackeray's serials from the green-covered serials\r\nof Dickens. But the sales of the first half-dozen numbers were by no means\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"I still remember,\" writes Lady Ritchie, \"going along Kensington Gardens\r\nwith my sister and our nursemaid, carrying a parcel of yellow numbers\r\nwhich had been given us to take to some friend who lived across the Park;\r\nand as we walked along, somewhere near the gates of the gardens we met my\r\nfather, who asked us what we were carrying. Then somehow he seemed vexed\r\nand troubled, told us not to go on, and to take the parcel home. Then he\r\nchanged his mind, saying that if his grandmother wished it, the books had\r\nbest be conveyed; but we guessed, as children do, that something was\r\nseriously amiss. The sale of _Vanity Fair_ was so small that it was a\r\nquestion at the time whether its publication should not be discontinued\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THACKERAY'S HOUSE. KENSINGTON.]\r\n\r\nAt that critical juncture he published _Mrs. Perkins's Ball_, which caught\r\non at once, and this and a favourable review in the _Edinburgh_ are\r\nsupposed to have sent the public after the novel, for the sales of _Vanity\r\nFair_ rapidly increased, and the monthly numbers were soon selling briskly\r\nenough to satisfy even the publishers, and so in his thirty-seventh year\r\nThackeray found himself famous. James Hannay first saw him when the\r\nbook was still unfinished but its success assured. He says that Thackeray\r\npointed out to him the house in Russell Square \"where the imaginary\r\nSedleys lived,\" and that when he congratulated him on that scene in\r\n_Vanity Fair_ in which Becky Sharp cannot help feeling proud of her\r\nhusband whilst he is giving Lord Steyne the thrashing that must ruin all\r\nher own chances, Thackeray answered frankly, \"Well, when I wrote that\r\nsentence I slapped my fist on the table and said, 'That is a touch of\r\ngenius!'\" Which reminds one of the story told by Ticknor Fields of how,\r\nwhen he was making a pilgrimage around London with Thackeray in later\r\nyears, and they paused outside 16 Young Street, which was no longer his\r\nhome, the novelist cried with a melodramatic gesture, \"Go down on your\r\nknees, you rogue, for here _Vanity Fair_ was penned, and I will go down\r\nwith you, for I have a high opinion of that little production myself!\"\r\n\r\nHis letters of 1847 and the early half of 1848 are full of references to\r\nthe strenuous toil with which he is writing his monthly instalments of\r\n_Vanity Fair_, and in one of them, to Edward Fitzgerald, he mentions that\r\nhe is giving a party: \"Mrs. Dickens and Miss Hogarth made me give it, and\r\nI am in a great fright.\" Perhaps that was the famous party to which\r\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb, Carlyle and his wife, and other of his great\r\ncontemporaries came, and things went wrong, and he became so uncomfortable\r\nthat he fairly bolted from his guests, and went to spend the rest of the\r\nevening at the Garrick Club.\r\n\r\n_Pendennis_ was written at the Young Street house, and Thackeray put a\r\ngood deal of himself into that hero of his. Pen had chambers at Lamb\r\nBuilding, in the Temple, and there is some likeness between his early\r\njournalistic experiences and Thackeray's own. The opening chapters of\r\n_Pendennis_, though, were written at Spa. Thackeray had wanted to get away\r\nto some seaside place where he could set to work on his new book, and had\r\nasked his mother, who was going to Brighton, if she could not get a house\r\nfor \u00a360 that would have three spare rooms in it for him. \"As for the\r\ndignity, I don't believe it matters a pinch of snuff. Tom Carlyle lives in\r\nperfect dignity in a little \u00a340 house at Chelsea, with a snuffy Scotch\r\nmaid to open the door, and the best company in England ringing at it. It\r\nis only the second or third chop great folks who care about show.\"\r\n\r\nIn _Pendennis_ there is an allusion to Catherine Hayes, the dreadful\r\nheroine of Thackeray's _Catherine_, that had been published a few years\r\nbefore, and a hot-tempered young Irishman, believing the reference was to\r\nMiss Catherine Hayes, the Irish vocalist, chivalrously came over to\r\nEngland, took lodgings opposite Thackeray's house in Young Street, and\r\nsent him a warning letter that he was on the watch for him to come out of\r\ndoors, and intended to administer public chastisement by way of avenging\r\nMiss Hayes's injured honour. After getting through his morning's work,\r\nThackeray felt the position was intolerable, so he walked straightway out\r\nacross the road, knocked at the opposite door, and boldly bearded the lion\r\nin his den. The young Irishman was disposed to bluster and be obstinate,\r\nbut Thackeray explained matters, calmed him, convinced him that he had\r\nmade a mistake, parted from him amicably, and had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the young fire-eater come forth on his way back home that evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. M. THACKERAY]\r\n\r\nWriting of _Pendennis_, Lady Ritchie says, \"I can remember the morning\r\nHelen died. My father was in his study in Young Street, sitting at the\r\ntable at which he wrote. It stood in the middle of the room, and he used\r\nto sit facing the door. I was going into the room, but he motioned me\r\naway. An hour afterwards he came into our schoolroom, half laughing and\r\nhalf ashamed, and said to us, 'I do not know what James can have thought\r\nof me when he came in with the tax-gatherer just after you left and found\r\nme blubbering over Helen Pendennis's death.'\"\r\n\r\nAt Young Street, Thackeray wrote also his _Lectures on the English\r\nHumorists_, and having delivered them with gratifying success at Willis's\r\nRooms, he journeyed to America in 1852, and was even more successful with\r\nthem there. Meanwhile, he had written _Esmond_, and it was published in\r\nthree volumes just before he left England. \"Thackeray I saw for ten\r\nminutes,\" Fitzgerald wrote to Frederick Tennyson concerning a flying visit\r\nhe had paid to London; \"he was just in the agony of finishing a novel,\r\nwhich has arisen out of the reading necessary for his lectures, and\r\nrelates to those times--of Queen Anne, I mean. He will get \u00a31000 for his\r\nnovel; he was wanting to finish it and rush off to the Continent to shake\r\noff the fumes of it.\" His two daughters, both now in their teens, were\r\nsent out to join their grandparents before he sailed for the States, and\r\nin a letter to Anne (Lady Ritchie) he explains his motive in crossing the\r\nAtlantic: \"I must and will go to America, not because I want to, but\r\nbecause it is right I should secure some money against my death for your\r\npoor mother and you two girls.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several drawings made by Thackeray in those Young Street days of\r\nhis daughters and himself, and one of his study at breakfast time, and\r\nhere is a word-picture of the study given by Lady Ritchie in her preface\r\nto _Esmond_: \"The vine shaded the two windows, which looked out upon the\r\nbit of garden and the medlar-tree, and the Spanish jasmines, of which the\r\nyellow flowers scented our old brick walls. I can remember the tortoise\r\nbelonging to the boys next door crawling along the top of the wall where\r\nthey had set it, and making its way between the jasmine sprigs.... Our\r\ngarden was not tidy (though on one grand occasion a man came to mow the\r\ngrass), but it was full of sweet things.... Lady Duff Gordon came to stay\r\nwith us once (it was on that occasion that the grass was mowed), and she\r\nafterwards sent us some doves, which used to hang high up in a wicker cage\r\nfrom the windows of the schoolroom. The schoolroom was over my father's\r\nbedroom, and his bedroom was over the study where he used to write, and\r\nthey all looked to the garden and the sunsets.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return from the American lecturing, in 1853, when he had already\r\nmade a beginning of _The Newcomes_, he gave up the Young Street house and\r\nmoved to 36 Onslow Square, South Kensington (or Brompton, as it was called\r\nat that period); and during the seven years of his residence there he\r\nfinished _The Newcomes_, wrote _The Four Georges_, _The Virginians_, many\r\nof the _Roundabout Papers_, began the writing of _Philip_, and founded and\r\nentered upon his duties as editor of the _Cornhill Magazine_. The front\r\nroom on the second floor was his study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMB BUILDING. TEMPLE. FROM THE CLOISTERS.]\r\n\r\nIt was whilst Thackeray was living here that the quarrel occurred between\r\nhim and Edmund Yates, who had contributed a smart personal article to\r\n_Town Talk_, on the 12th June 1858, in the course of which he wrote: \"Mr.\r\nThackeray is forty-six years old, though from the silvery whiteness of his\r\nhair he appears somewhat older. He is very tall, standing upwards of six\r\nfeet two inches; and as he walks erect his height makes him conspicuous in\r\nevery assembly. His face is bloodless, and not particularly expressive,\r\nbut remarkable for the fracture of the bridge of the nose, the result of\r\nan accident in youth. He wears a small grey whisker, but otherwise is\r\nclean shaven. No one meeting him could fail to recognise in him a\r\ngentleman; his bearing is cold and uninviting, his style of conversation\r\neither openly cynical, or affectedly good-natured and benevolent; his\r\n_bonhomie_ is forced, his wit biting, his pride easily touched--but his\r\nappearance is invariably that of the cool, suave, well-bred gentleman who,\r\nwhatever may be rankling within, suffers no surface display of his\r\nemotion.\" He went on to discuss Thackeray's work, and said unjustly of his\r\nlectures that in this country he flattered the aristocracy and in America\r\nhe attacked it, the attacks being contained in _The Four Georges_, which\r\n\"have been dead failures in England, though as literary compositions they\r\nare most excellent. Our own opinion is that his success is on the wane;\r\nhis writings never were understood or appreciated even by the middle\r\nclasses; the aristocracy have been alienated by his American onslaught on\r\ntheir body, and the educated and refined are not sufficiently numerous to\r\nconstitute an audience; moreover, there is a want of heart in all he\r\nwrites which is not to be balanced by the most brilliant sarcasm.\"\r\n\r\nThe description of Thackeray's personal appearance here is perhaps rather\r\nimpertinently frank, but it is clever and pictorially good; for the\r\nrest--we who know now what a generous, kindly, almost too sentimentally\r\ntender heart throbbed within that husk of cynicism and sarcasm in which he\r\nprotectively enfolded it, know that Yates was writing of what he did not\r\nunderstand. Unfortunately, however, Thackeray took him seriously, and\r\nwrote a letter of dignified but angry protest to him, especially against\r\nthe imputation of insincerity when he spoke good-naturedly in private.\r\n\"Had your remarks been written by a person unknown to me, I should have\r\nnoticed them no more than other calumnies; but as we have shaken hands\r\nmore than once and met hitherto on friendly terms, I am obliged to take\r\nnotice of articles which I consider to be not offensive and unfriendly\r\nmerely, but slanderous and untrue. We meet at a club where, before you\r\nwere born, I believe, I and other gentlemen have been in the habit of\r\ntalking without any idea that our conversation would supply paragraphs for\r\nprofessional vendors of 'Literary Talk'; and I don't remember that out of\r\nthe club I have ever exchanged six words with you.\"\r\n\r\nYates replied, and \"rather than have further correspondence with a writer\r\nof that character,\" Thackeray put the letters before the committee of the\r\nGarrick Club, asking them to decide whether the publication of such an\r\narticle as Yates had written was not intolerable in a society of gentlemen\r\nand fatal to the comfort of the club. The committee resolved that Yates\r\nmust either apologise or resign his membership. Then Dickens, thinking the\r\ncommittee were exceeding their powers, intervened on Yates's behalf; wrote\r\nto Thackeray in a conciliatory strain, and asked if any conference could\r\nbe held between himself, as representing Yates, and some friend who should\r\nrepresent Thackeray, with a view to arriving at a friendly settlement of\r\nthe unpleasantness. This apparently well-intentioned interference annoyed\r\nThackeray; he curtly replied that he preferred to leave his interests in\r\nthe hands of the club committee, and as a result he and Dickens were\r\nbitterly estranged. That the friendship between two such men should have\r\nbeen broken by such a petty incident was deplorable enough, but happily,\r\nonly a few days before Thackeray's death, they chanced to meet in the\r\nlobby of the Athen\u00e6um, and by a mutual impulse each offered his hand to\r\nthe other, and the breach was healed.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Thackeray made his last change of address, and went to No. 2\r\nPalace Green, Kensington, a large and handsome house that he had built for\r\nhimself. Some of his friends thought that in building it he had spent his\r\nmoney recklessly, but he did it in pursuance of the desire, that crops up\r\nso frequently in his correspondence, to make some provision for the future\r\nof his children; and when, after his death, it was sold for \u00a32000 more\r\nthan it had cost him, he was sufficiently justified. It was in this house\r\nthat he finished _Philip_, and, having retired from the editing of the\r\n_Cornhill_, began to write _Denis Duval_, but died on Christmas Eve 1863,\r\nleaving it little more than well begun. When he was writing _Pendennis_ he\r\nhad been near death's door, and ever since he had suffered from attacks of\r\nsickness almost every month. He was not well when his valet left him at\r\neleven on the night of the 23rd December; about midnight his mother, whose\r\nbedroom was immediately over his, heard him walking about his room; at\r\nnine next morning, when his valet went in with his coffee, he saw him\r\n\"lying on his back quite still, with his arms spread over the coverlet,\r\nbut he took no notice, as he was accustomed to see his master thus after\r\none of his attacks.\" Returning later, and finding the coffee untouched on\r\nthe table beside the bed, he felt a sudden apprehension, and was horrified\r\nto discover that Thackeray was dead.\r\n\r\nYates has told how the rumour of his death ran through the clubs and was\r\nsoon all about the town, and of how, wherever it went, it left a cloud\r\nover everything that Christmas Eve; and I have just turned up one of my\r\nold _Cornhill_ volumes to read again what Dickens and Trollope wrote of\r\nhim in the number for February 1864. \"I saw him first,\" says Dickens,\r\n\"nearly twenty-eight years ago, when he proposed to be the illustrator of\r\nmy earliest book. I saw him last, shortly before Christmas, at the\r\nAthen\u00e6um Club, when he told me that he had been in bed three days--that\r\nafter these attacks he was troubled with cold shiverings, 'which quite\r\ntook the power of work out of him'--and that he had it in his mind to try\r\na new remedy, which he laughingly described. He was very cheerful, and\r\nlooked very bright. In the night of that day week, he died.\" Dickens goes\r\non to give little instances of his kindness, of his great and good nature;\r\nand then describes how he was found lying dead. \"He was only in his\r\nfifty-third year; so young a man that the mother who blessed him in his\r\nfirst sleep blessed him in his last.\" And says Trollope, no one is\r\nthinking just then of the greatness of his work--\"The fine grey head, the\r\ndear face with its gentle smile, the sweet, manly voice which we knew so\r\nwell, with its few words of kindest greeting; the gait and manner, the\r\npersonal presence of him whom it so delighted us to encounter in our\r\ncasual comings and goings about the town--it is of these things, and of\r\nthese things lost for ever, that we are now thinking. We think of them as\r\ntreasures which are not only lost, but which can never be replaced. He who\r\nknew Thackeray will have a vacancy in his heart's inmost casket which must\r\nremain vacant till he dies. One loved him almost as one loves a woman,\r\ntenderly and with thoughtfulness--thinking of him when away from him as a\r\nsource of joy which cannot be analysed, but is full of comfort. One who\r\nloved him, loved him thus because his heart was tender, as is the heart of\r\na woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThackeray's London was practically bounded on the east by the Temple, or\r\nperhaps by the Fleet Prison, which lay a little beyond the _Punch_ office;\r\nit took in the Strand, Pall Mall, Piccadilly, and stretched out westward\r\nround Belgravia, Mayfair, Chiswick, and such selecter quarters of the\r\ntown. But Dickens made the whole of London his province; you cannot go\r\ninto any part of it but he has been there before you; if he did not at one\r\ntime live there himself, some of his characters did. Go north through\r\nSomers Town and Camden Town: the homes of his boyhood were there in Bayham\r\nStreet, in Little College Street, in the house that still stands at 13\r\nJohnson Street, from which he walked daily to school at the Wellington\r\nHouse Academy in Hampstead Road. He lived in Cleveland Street, Fitzroy\r\nSquare, and in Fitzroy Street, and whilst his father was a prisoner in the\r\nMarshalsea for debt and he himself was labelling bottles at the blacking\r\nfactory in Hungerford Market, he had lodgings south of London Bridge in\r\nLant Street, which were the originals of the lodgings he gave to Bob\r\nSawyer in later years when he came to write _Pickwick_. When he was turned\r\ntwenty, and working as a Parliamentary reporter in the House of Commons,\r\nand beginning to contribute his _Sketches by Boz_ to the _Monthly\r\nMagazine_, he lived at 18 Bentinck Street, Cavendish Square. For a time he\r\nhad lodgings in Buckingham Street, Strand, and afterwards lodged David\r\nCopperfield in the same rooms; he put up for a short time at Fulham before\r\nhis marriage at St. Luke's Church, Chelsea, in April 1836, and after a\r\nbrief honeymoon returned with his wife to the chambers in Furnival's Inn\r\nthat he had rented since the previous year. He had three other London\r\nhouses during his more prosperous days; then he quitted the town and went\r\nto live at Gad's Hill Place, where he died in 1870. But even after he was\r\nthus settled in Kent, he was continually up and down to the office of\r\n_Household Words_, in Wellington Street, Strand, and for some part of\r\nalmost every year he occupied a succession of furnished houses round about\r\nHyde Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DICKENS. JOHNSON STREET. CAMDEN TOWN.]\r\n\r\nA few months before his marriage he had started to write _Pickwick_, the\r\nfirst monthly part of which appeared in March 1836. Before the end of next\r\nmonth, Seymour, the artist who was illustrating that serial, having\r\ncommitted suicide, Thackeray went up to the Furnival's Inn chambers with\r\nspecimens of his drawings in the hope of becoming his successor, but\r\nDickens rejected him in favour of Hablot K. Browne (\"Phiz\"), who also\r\nillustrated most of his subsequent books. He had published the _Sketches\r\nby Boz_ in two volumes, illustrated by Cruikshank, had written two\r\ndramatic pieces that were very successfully produced at the St. James's\r\nTheatre, had begun to edit _Bentley's Miscellany_, and was writing _Oliver\r\nTwist_ for it, before he left Furnival's Inn and established his small\r\nhousehold of his wife and their first son and his wife's sister, Mary\r\nHogarth, at 48 Doughty Street, Mecklenburgh Square.\r\n\r\nIn later years Sala, who became one of Dickens's principal contributors to\r\n_Household Words_, used to live in Mecklenburgh Square, and at different\r\ntimes Sidney Smith, Shirley Brooks, and Edmund Yates all lived in Doughty\r\nStreet (Shirley Brooks was born there, at No. 52), but Doughty Street's\r\nchief glory is that for the greater part of three years Dickens was the\r\ntenant of No. 48. George Henry Lewes called to see him there, and was\r\nperturbed to find that he had nothing on his bookshelves but three-volume\r\nnovels and presentation copies of books of travel; clearly he was not much\r\nof a reader, and had never been a haunter of old bookstalls. But presently\r\nDickens came in, says Lewes, \"and his sunny presence quickly dispelled all\r\nmisgivings. He was then, as to the last, a delightful companion, full of\r\nsagacity as well as animal spirits; but I came away more impressed with\r\nthe fulness of life and energy than with any sense of distinction.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cowden Clarke, who saw him in his Doughty Street days, speaks of him\r\nas \"genial, bright, lively-spirited, pleasant-toned,\" and says he \"entered\r\ninto conversation with a grace and charm that made it feel perfectly\r\nnatural to be chatting and laughing as if we had known each other from\r\nchildhood.\" His eyes she describes as \"large, dark blue, exquisitely\r\nshaped, fringed with magnificently long and thick lashes--they now swam in\r\nliquid, limpid suffusion, when tears started into them from a sense of\r\nhumour or a sense of pathos, and now darted quick flashes of fire when\r\nsome generous indignation at injustice, or some high-wrought feeling of\r\nadmiration at magnanimity, or some sudden emotion of interest and\r\nexcitement touched him. Swift-glancing, appreciative, rapidly observant,\r\ntruly superb orbits they were, worthy of the other features in his manly,\r\nhandsome face. The mouth was singularly mobile, full-lipped, well-shaped,\r\nand expressive; sensitive, nay restless, in its susceptibility to\r\nimpressions that swayed him, or sentiment that moved him.\" Which tallies\r\nsufficiently with Carlyle's well-known description of him a few months\r\nlater: \"A fine little fellow, Boz, I think. Clear, blue, intelligent eyes,\r\neyebrows that he arches amazingly; large, protrusive, rather loose mouth,\r\na face of most extreme mobility which he shuttles about--eyebrows, eyes,\r\nmouth and all--in a very singular manner while speaking. Surmount this\r\nwith a loose coil of common-coloured hair, and set it on a small, compact\r\nfigure, very small, and dressed _\u00e2 la_ D'Orsay rather than well--this is\r\nPickwick. For the rest, a quiet, shrewd-looking little fellow, who seems\r\nto guess pretty well what he is and what others are.\" Forster sketches\r\nhis face at this same period with \"the quickness, keenness, and practical\r\npower, the eager, restless, energetic outlook on each several feature,\r\nthat seemed to tell so little of a student and writer of books, and so\r\nmuch of a man of action and business in the world. Light and motion\r\nflashed from every part of it.\" \"It was as if made of steel,\" said Mrs.\r\nCarlyle; and \"What a face is his to meet in a drawing-room,\" wrote Leigh\r\nHunt. \"It has the life and soul in it of fifty human beings.\"\r\n\r\nDickens's weakness, then and all his life through, was for something too\r\ndazzling and ornate in the way of personal adornment. We hear of a green\r\novercoat with red cuffs. \"His dress was florid,\" says one who met him: \"a\r\nsatin cravat of the deepest blue relieved by embroideries, a green\r\nwaistcoat with gold flowers, a dress coat with a velvet collar and satin\r\nfacings, opulence of white cuff, rings in excess, made up a rather\r\nstriking whole.\" And there is a story of how, when an artist friend of\r\nboth was presented by somebody with a too gaudy length of material, Wilkie\r\nCollins advised him to \"Give it to Dickens--he'll make a waistcoat out of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DICKENS' HOUSE. DOUGHTY STREET.]\r\n\r\nThat jest belongs to a later year, but here you have a sufficiently vivid\r\npresentment of the man as he was when he could be seen passing in and out\r\nof the house in Doughty Street. He may have been dandified in appearance,\r\nbut in all his other habits he was a hard and severely methodical worker.\r\n\"His hours and days were spent by rule,\" we are told. \"He rose at a\r\ncertain time, he retired at another, and though no precisian, it was not\r\noften that his arrangements varied. His hours of writing were between\r\nbreakfast and luncheon, and when there was any work to be done no\r\ntemptation was sufficiently strong to cause it to be neglected. This order\r\nand regularity followed him through the day. His mind was essentially\r\nmethodical, and in his long walks, in his recreations, in his labour, he\r\nwas governed by rules laid down by himself, rules well studied beforehand\r\nand rarely departed from.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DICKENS]\r\n\r\nHis rise out of poverty and obscurity into affluence and fame makes a more\r\nwonderful story than that of how Byron woke one morning and found himself\r\nfamous. For Dickens had everything against him. He was indifferently\r\neducated, had no social advantages, and no influential friends behind him.\r\nIn 1835 he was an unknown young author, writing miscellaneous stories and\r\nsketches for the papers; by the end of 1836 everybody was reading and\r\nraving of and laughing over _Pickwick_, and he was the most talked-of\r\nnovelist of the hour. \"It sprang into a popularity that each part carried\r\nhigher and higher,\" says Forster, \"until people at this time talked of\r\nnothing else, tradesmen recommended their goods by using its name, and its\r\nsale, outstripping at a bound that of all the most famous books of the\r\ncentury, had reached an almost fabulous number.\" Judges, street boys, old\r\nand young in every class of life, devoured each month's number directly it\r\nappeared, and looked forward impatiently to the next one. Carlyle told\r\nForster that \"an archdeacon, with his own venerable lips, repeated to me\r\nthe other night a strange, profane story of a solemn clergyman who had\r\nbeen administering ghostly consolation to a sick person; having finished,\r\nsatisfactorily as he thought, and got out of the room, he heard the sick\r\nperson ejaculate: 'Well, thank God, _Pickwick_ will be out in ten days,\r\nany way!'\"\r\n\r\nDickens's favourite recreation in those early years was riding, and\r\nfrequently he would set out with Forster \"at eleven in the morning for 'a\r\nfifteen mile ride out, ditto in, and lunch on the road,' with a wind-up of\r\nsix o'clock dinner in Doughty Street.\" Other times he would send a note\r\nround to Forster, who lived at 58 Lincoln's Inn Fields, and if he could be\r\npersuaded to come, as generally he could, they would set out for a brisk\r\nwalk to Hampstead and over the Heath, and have \"a red-hot chop for dinner\r\nand a glass of good wine\" at Jack Straw's Castle.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Mamie was born in Doughty Street, and there the first great\r\ngrief of his life completely overwhelmed him for a time, when his wife's\r\nyoung sister, Mary Hogarth, died at the age of seventeen. There are\r\nseveral letters from that address in 1838 concerning his progress with\r\n_Oliver Twist_. In one, when he could not work, he says he is \"sitting\r\npatiently at home waiting for Oliver Twist, who has not yet arrived.\" In\r\nanother he writes, \"I worked pretty well last night--very well indeed; but\r\nalthough I did eleven close slips before half-past twelve I have four to\r\nwrite to close the chapter; and as I foolishly left them till this\r\nmorning, have the steam to get up afresh.\" \"Hard at work still,\" he writes\r\nto Forster in August 1838. \"Nancy is no more. I showed what I had done to\r\nKate last night, who is in an unspeakable '_state_'; from which and my own\r\nimpression I augur well. When I have sent Sykes to the devil I must have\r\nyours.\" And \"No, no,\" he wrote again to Forster next month, \"don't, don't\r\nlet us ride till to-morrow, not having yet disposed of the Jew, who is\r\nsuch an out-and-outer that I don't know what to make of him.\" Then one\r\nevening Forster went to Doughty Street and sat in Dickens's study and\r\ntalked over the last chapter of _Oliver Twist_ with him, and remained\r\nreading there whilst he wrote it.\r\n\r\nFrom Doughty Street Dickens and \"Phiz\" set out together on that journey\r\ninto Yorkshire to see the notorious school that was to become famous as\r\nSqueers's, and in due course there are letters from that street telling of\r\nthe progress of _Nicholas Nickleby_. Early in 1839 the letters tell of how\r\nhe is house-hunting, and in the intervals working \"at racehorse speed\" on\r\n_Barnaby Rudge_, and near the end of the year he moved to 1 Devonshire\r\nTerrace, at the corner of Marylebone Road.\r\n\r\nThe Doughty Street house remains as he left it, but 1 Devonshire Terrace\r\nhas been rather considerably altered. The new residence was such a much\r\nmore imposing one than the other that absurd rumours got about that he was\r\nlapsing into extravagance and living beyond his income, and \"I perfectly\r\nremember,\" writes Sala, \"when he moved from his modest residence in\r\nDoughty Street to a much grander but still not very palatial house in\r\nDevonshire Terrace, an old gentleman calling one day upon my mother and\r\ntelling her, with a grave countenance, that Dickens had pawned his plate,\r\nand had been waited upon for the last fortnight by bailiffs in livery.\" It\r\nwas about this time, too, that the _Quarterly_ made its famous prediction\r\nthat in the case of work such as Dickens was doing \"an ephemeral\r\npopularity will be followed by an early oblivion.\" But there was no ground\r\nfor any of these fears. His life was a triumphal procession; he went\r\nforward from victory to victory. At Devonshire Terrace he wrote most of\r\n_Barnaby Rudge_: and the prototype of Grip, Barnaby's raven, the special\r\nplaymate of Dickens's children, died there; from here he went on his first\r\nvisit to America, and on his return, with intervals of holiday at\r\nBroadstairs, in Cornwall, and in Italy, wrote the _American Notes_,\r\n_Martin Chuzzlewit_, _The Chimes_, _The Cricket on the Hearth_, _Pictures\r\nfrom Italy_, _Dombey and Son_, and commenced the writing of _David\r\nCopperfield_. Whilst he was here, too, he was for a brief space the first\r\neditor of the _Daily News_, and in March 1850 opened his Wellington Street\r\noffice and started _Household Words_. Incidentally, he was taking an\r\nactive share in a dozen or more public movements; acting as chairman at\r\nmeetings and dinners, managing and playing in private theatricals, writing\r\nmiscellaneous articles for his new magazine, and attending closely to its\r\nbusiness organisation. Never was a more strenuous literary worker, or one\r\nwho brought more enthusiasm to whatever he undertook.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1851, in the flowing and rising tide of his prosperity,\r\nhe removed to the now vanished Tavistock House, in Tavistock Square, and\r\nin the next six years, before his removal to Gad's Hill, wrote _Bleak\r\nHouse_, _Hard Times_, and _Little Dorrit_, to say nothing of the numerous\r\nshort stories and articles he contributed to _Household Words_, and began\r\nto give those public readings from his books that were in his last decade\r\nto occupy so much of his time, add so enormously to his income and his\r\npersonal popularity, and play so sinister a part in the breaking down of\r\nhis health and the shortening of his career.\r\n\r\nWriting immediately after Dickens's death, Sala said that twenty years ago\r\nthe face and form of Sir Robert Peel were familiar to almost everybody who\r\npassed him in the street, and \"there were as few last week who would have\r\nbeen unable to point out the famous novelist, with his thought-lined face,\r\nhis grizzled beard, his wondrous searching eyes, his bluff presence and\r\nswinging gait as, head aloft, he strode, now through crowded streets,\r\nlooking seemingly neither to the right nor the left, but of a surety\r\nlooking at and into everything--now at the myriad aspects of London life,\r\nthe ever-changing raree-show, the endless roundabout, the infinite\r\nkaleidoscope of wealth and pauperism, of happiness and misery, of good and\r\nevil in this Babylon--now over the pleasant meads and breezy downs which\r\nstretched round his modest Kentish demesne hard by the hoary tower of\r\nRochester.... Who had not heard him read, and who had not seen his\r\nphotographs in the shop windows? The omnibus conductors knew him, the\r\nstreet boys knew him; and perhaps the locality where his recognition would\r\nhave been least frequent--for all that he was a member of the Athen\u00e6um\r\nClub--was Pall Mall. Elsewhere he would make his appearance in the oddest\r\nplaces, and in the most inclement weather: in Ratcliff Highway, on\r\nHaverstock Hill, on Camberwell Green, in Gray's Inn Lane, in the\r\nWandsworth Road, at Hammersmith Broadway, in Norton Folgate, and at Kensal\r\nNew Town.... His carriage was remarkably upright, his mien almost\r\naggressive in its confidence--a bronzed, weatherworn, hardy man, with\r\nsomewhat of a seaman's air about him.\" London folks would draw aside, he\r\ncontinues, \"as the great writer--who seemed always to be walking a match\r\nagainst Thought--strode on, and, looking after him, say, 'There goes\r\nCharles Dickens!' The towering stature, the snowy locks, the glistening\r\nspectacles, the listless, slouching port, as that of a tired giant, of\r\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray were familiar enough likewise but,\r\ncomparatively speaking, only to a select few. He belonged to Clubland, and\r\nwas only to be seen sauntering there or in West End squares, or on his\r\nroad to his beloved Kensington.... Thackeray in Houndsditch, Thackeray in\r\nBethnal Green or at Camden Town, would have appeared anomalous ... but\r\nCharles Dickens, when in town, was ubiquitous.\"\r\n\r\nThere are statues in London of many smaller men, of many who mean little\r\nor nothing in particular to London, but there is none to Dickens, and\r\nperhaps he needs none. Little critics may decry him, but it makes no\r\ndifference, it takes nothing from his immortality. \"It is fatuous,\" as\r\nTrollope said of his work, \"to condemn that as deficient in art which has\r\nbeen so full of art as to captivate all men.\" And to the thousands of us\r\nwho know the people and the world that he created he is still ubiquitous\r\nin London here, even though he has his place for ever, as Swinburne says,\r\namong the stars and suns that we behold not:\r\n\r\n  \"Where stars and suns that we behold not burn,\r\n     Higher even than here, though highest was here thy place,\r\n       Love sees thy spirit laugh and speak and shine\r\n   With Shakespeare and the soft bright soul of Sterne,\r\n     And Fielding's kindliest might and Goldsmith's grace;\r\n       Scarce one more loved or worthier love than thine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was writing of what remains to us of the London of Shakespeare, I\r\nmight have mentioned the four-century-old gateway of Lincoln's Inn, in\r\nChancery Lane, that Ben Jonson helped to build, and close by which, at 24\r\nOld Buildings, Cromwell's secretary, John Thurloe, lived in 1654; and\r\nalthough in my first chapter I gave a fairly lengthy list of famous\r\nauthors and artists who were Cockneys by birth, I by no means made it so\r\nlong as I could have done. Hablot K. Browne, otherwise \"Phiz,\" the chief\r\nof Dickens's artists, was born in Kennington, and lived for eight years,\r\ntowards the close of his career, at 99 Ladbroke Grove Road; Lord Lytton,\r\nwhom Tennyson unkindly described as \"the padded man that wears the stays,\"\r\nand who was for a time a more popular novelist than either Dickens or\r\nThackeray, was born at 31 Baker Street, and lived in after years at 12\r\nGrosvenor Square, and at 36 Hertford Street; Gibbon was born at Putney,\r\nand lived for some years at 7 Bentinck Street, which he said was \"the best\r\nhouse in the world\"; John Leech was born over his father's coffee-shop in\r\nLudgate Hill, and lived when he had risen to fame at 32 Brunswick Square,\r\nand passed the last years of his life at 6 The Terrace, Kensington; and\r\none who I confess interests me at least as much as any of these,\r\nDouglas Jerrold, was born in Greek Street, Soho, lived as a boy at Broad\r\nCourt, in the same neighbourhood, and afterwards shifted about into\r\nhalf-a-dozen different parts of London, and died in 1857 at Kilburn\r\nPriory, on the skirts of St. John's Wood. West Lodge, his house at Lower\r\nPutney Common, still stands much as it was when he occupied it, with his\r\nmulberry tree still growing in that garden round which, one memorable\r\nsummer afternoon, he and Dickens, Forster, Maclise, and Macready gave each\r\nother \"backs,\" and played a joyously undignified game of leapfrog. I don't\r\nknow whether anybody reads _Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures_ now, but\r\neverybody read them and laughed over them when they were new, and\r\nJerrold's best jokes and witticisms are much too well known to leave me an\r\nexcuse for repeating any of them here. For all his bitter tongue, he was\r\nkind, generous, sensitive, afire with a fine scorn of wrong, injustice,\r\nand every variety of social humbug and snobbery. \"A small\r\ndelicately-formed, bent man,\" is Edmund Yates's recollection of him, \"with\r\nlong grey hair combed back from his forehead, with grey eyes deep-set\r\nunder penthouse brows, and a way, just as the inspiration seized him, of\r\ndangling a double-eyeglass which hung round his neck by a broad black\r\nribbon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THURLOE'S LODGINGS. 24 OLD SQUARE. LINCOLN'S INN.]\r\n\r\nBrowning, who was born at Hanover Cottage, Southampton Street, Camberwell,\r\nin 1812, lived at De Vere Gardens, and at 19 Warwick Crescent. Removing\r\nfrom 74 Gloucester Place in 1842, Elizabeth Barrett and her autocratic\r\nfather went to 50 Wimpole Street, and calling there with a friend in 1845,\r\nRobert Browning was introduced to her. It was from and to this house that\r\nso many of those wonderful love-letters of theirs were written, and little\r\nmore than a year after their first meeting, her father stubbornly refusing\r\nhis consent to their union, she stole out by this sedate and sombre door\r\none autumn morning to join her waiting lover, and they were quietly and\r\nclandestinely married at the old church round the corner in Marylebone\r\nRoad--the same church in which, in the same year, Dickens, then living at\r\nDevonshire House and within sight of it, married Mr. Dombey, with Captain\r\nCuttle looking on at the ceremony from the gallery.\r\n\r\nAt 82 Wimpole Street Wilkie Collins died; and at 67, lived Henry Hallam,\r\nthe historian, and his son Arthur, the friend of Tennyson, who often\r\nvisited him there, and has enshrined his memory for ever in his _In\r\nMemoriam_; where, too, he pictures this house and this street:\r\n\r\n  \"Dark house, by which once more I stand\r\n     Here in the long unlovely street,\r\n     Doors, where my heart was used to beat\r\n   So quickly, waiting for a hand.\r\n\r\n   A hand that can be clasped no more--\r\n     Behold me, for I cannot sleep,\r\n     And like a guilty thing I creep\r\n   At earliest morning to the door.\r\n\r\n   He is not here; but far away\r\n     The noise of life begins again,\r\n     And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain\r\n   On the bald street breaks the blank day.\"\r\n\r\nTheodore Hook, another Cockney, was born in Charlotte Street, Bedford\r\nSquare; Captain Marryat, another, in Great George Street, Westminster,\r\nand whilst he was writing the most famous of his books he lived at 8 Duke\r\nStreet, St. James's, and at Sussex Lodge, in the Fulham Road. Ruskin, who,\r\nlike Browning, is included in my earlier list of Cockneys, was born at 54\r\nHunter Street, and made his home for many years at 163 Denmark Hill, both\r\nof which houses still survive him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN MARRYAT. DUKE STREET. ST. JAMES.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin lived at 7 Craven Street, Strand; before he rented a\r\nhouse in London after Johnson's death, Boswell had lodgings, on his annual\r\nvisits to town, in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, in Conduit Street, Regent\r\nStreet, and in Old Bond Street; where Sterne dwelt before him and Gibbon\r\nafter him, and at 27A, Harrison Ainsworth, later than them all; but\r\nAinsworth's more notable residence, where he lived when he was in the full\r\nglory of his enormous popularity, is Kensal House, out in the\r\nno-longer-rural district of Kensal Green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S HOUSE. CRAVEN STREET.]\r\n\r\nAt 19 Albert Gate, Sloane Street, lived Charles Reade, who was nearly all\r\nhis life quarrelling with his critics and fighting against legal\r\ninjustices with an almost ungovernable fury, and yet David Christie Murray\r\nsaid he was one of the four men he had met who were \"distinguished by that\r\nsplendid urbanity of manner which was once thought to express the acme of\r\nhigh breeding.... A beautiful, stately cordiality commonly marked his\r\nsocial manner, but he could be moved to a towering rage by an act of\r\nmeanness, treachery, or oppression; and in his public correspondence he\r\nwas sometimes downright vitriolic.\" Anthony Trollope died at 34 Welbeck\r\nStreet; and Lord Macaulay at Holly Lodge on Campden Hill. George\r\nCruikshank lived in the queer, dull-looking little house that still\r\nremains at 263 Hampstead Road, and from that address put forth his\r\ngroundless claims to being the originator of Ainsworth's novels, _Jack\r\nSheppard_ and _The Miser's Daughter_, and Dickens's _Oliver Twist_.\r\nAinsworth was still living, and strenuously denied his assertions; Dickens\r\nwas dead, but there existed a letter of his about the illustrations to his\r\nbook that sufficiently proved that the story was not written round\r\nCruickshank's drawings, as the aged artist seemed to have persuaded\r\nhimself it was. A greater artist than Cruickshank (and another Cockney, by\r\nthe way) was born in Cumberland Market, near Regent's Park, and died in a\r\nsponging-house in Eyre Street Hill, Clerkenwell Road, in 1804. That was\r\nGeorge Morland. Two years before his death he went with his wife and put\r\nup at the Bull Inn, at Highgate, which was kept by a former acquaintance\r\nof his. He is supposed to have utilised as a studio the large room with\r\nthree bay windows that runs above the bar the full width of the building.\r\nHe entertained Gainsborough and Romney and other contemporary artists\r\nthere, but within a few months had had a fierce quarrel with the landlord\r\nand returned to lodge with his brother in Dean Street, Soho. He was by\r\nthen showing the effects of his reckless dissipations, and looked\r\n\"besotted and squalid and cadaverous; hanging cheeks and pinched nose,\r\ncontracted nostrils, bleared and bloodshot eyes, swelled legs, a palsied\r\nhand, and tremulous voice bespeaking the ruin of what had once been the\r\nsoundest of frames.\" Drunk or sober, he worked rapidly and with unfailing\r\nmastery, but he was generally cheated by those around him of the due\r\nreward of his labours. Going on a short holiday to Brighton, he wrote\r\ngiving his brother this list of what he had drunk in a single day:\r\n\"Hollands gin, rum and milk--before breakfast. Coffee--for breakfast.\r\nHollands, porter, shrub, ale, Hollands, port wine and ginger, bottled\r\nale--these before dinner. Port wine at dinner. Porter, bottled porter,\r\npunch, porter, ale, opium and water. Port wine at supper. Gin, shrub, and\r\nrum on going to bed.\" At the bottom of the list he sketched a tombstone\r\nbearing a skull and crossbones, and by way of epitaph: \"Here lies a\r\ndrunken dog.\" And debts and duns and death in the sponging-house were the\r\ninevitable end of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUIKSHANK. 263 HAMPSTEAD ROAD.]\r\n\r\nLady Blessington held her brilliant salon at 8 Seamore Place, Mayfair,\r\nbefore in 1836 she removed to the more noted Gore House, Kensington, and\r\nwelcomed to her splendid drawing-rooms Byron, Lytton, Disraeli, Landor,\r\nMarryat, Dickens, Thackeray, Sydney Smith, Maclise, Hook, and all the\r\ngreatest men of the day in literature, art, politics, and society, till in\r\n1849 she was overwhelmed with financial embarrassments and fled to Paris,\r\nwhere she died the year after. Gore House has vanished from its place\r\nlong since, and the Albert Hall more than covers the site of it. But\r\nHolland House, which was equally or more celebrated for its magnificent\r\nsocial gatherings in the first half of last century and earlier, still\r\nholds its ground. Addison lived there after his marriage to the Countess\r\nof Warwick in 1716, and from his bedroom there, in his last hours, sent\r\nfor his dissipated stepson in order that he might see \"how a Christian can\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT BROWNING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE MORLAND. THE \"BULL INN\" HIGHGATE.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps more interesting than either of these, from a literary standpoint,\r\nis the house of Samuel Rogers, 22 St. James's Place, overlooking the Green\r\nPark. You can scarcely open the memoirs of any man of letters of his time,\r\nbut you may read some account of a breakfast or a dinner at Rogers's.\r\n\"What a delightful house it is!\" says Macaulay. \"It looks out on the Green\r\nPark just at the most pleasant point. The furniture has been selected with\r\na delicacy of taste quite unique.... In the drawing-room the\r\nchimney-pieces are carved by Flaxman into the most beautiful Grecian\r\nforms. The bookcase is painted by Stothard, in his very best manner, with\r\ngroups from Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Boccaccio. The pictures are not\r\nnumerous, but every one is excellent. The most remarkable objects in the\r\ndining-room are, I think, a cast of Pope, taken after death by Roubiliac;\r\na noble model in terra-cotta by Michael Angelo, from which he afterwards\r\nmade one of his finest statues, that of Lorenzo de Medici; and, lastly, a\r\nmahogany table on which stands an antique vase. When Chantrey dined with\r\nRogers some time ago he took particular notice of the vase and the table\r\non which it stands, and asked Rogers who made the table. 'A common\r\ncarpenter,' said Rogers. 'Do you remember the making of it?' said\r\nChantrey. 'Certainly,' said Rogers, in some surprise; 'I was in the room\r\nwhile it was finished with the chisel, and gave the workman directions\r\nabout placing it.' 'Yes,' said Chantrey, 'I was the carpenter.'\" Byron,\r\nwho was a guest at Holland House and at Lady Blessington's, was a frequent\r\nguest at Rogers's table also. It was Rogers who introduced him to Miss\r\nMilbanke, the unfortunate lady who was to become his wife; and Byron seems\r\nby turns to have admired him, disliked him, and looked upon him with a\r\nsort of laughing contempt. \"When Sheridan was on his deathbed,\" he writes,\r\n\"Rogers aided him with purse and person: this was particularly kind in\r\nRogers, who always spoke ill of Sheridan (to me, at least); but indeed he\r\ndoes that of everybody. Rogers is the reverse of the line 'The best good\r\nman with the worst-natured Muse,' being 'The worst good man with the\r\nbest-natured Muse.' His Muse being all sentiment and sago, while he\r\nhimself is a venomous talker. I say 'worst good man,' because he is\r\n(perhaps) a good man--at least he does good now and then, as well he may,\r\nto purchase himself a shilling's worth of Salvation for his Slanders. They\r\nare so _little_, too--small talk, and old womanny; and he is malignant\r\ntoo, and envious.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROGERS. ST. JAMES'S PLACE. FROM GREEN PARK.]\r\n\r\nRogers had a fine head, a distinguished manner, a bland, silky way of\r\nsaying the most cutting and cynical things. He was not so much a poet as a\r\nbanker of a poetical temperament. His poetry will presently be forgotten,\r\nbut his breakfasts and his dinners will be remembered because he lived to\r\nbe well over ninety, was a very wealthy man of taste, and had the will and\r\nthe means to play the generous host to some three generations of the\r\nwisest, wittiest, greatest men of his era, and several of them said\r\nbrighter and better things in his dining and drawing-rooms than he ever\r\nwrote in his books. He covered such a long span of time that he could\r\nentertain Sheridan, who was born in 1751, and Dickens, who died in 1870.\r\nMany of the same glorious company had a meeting-place also until a more\r\nrecent day at Bath House, Mayfair, where Lady Ashburton, the great friend\r\nof the Carlyles, held famous receptions, of which Carlyle himself and the\r\nBrookfields have left us reminiscences. And the invaluable Allingham has\r\none or two notes about her in his _Diary_; one dated 5th November 1875, in\r\nwhich he says Carlyle passed his house \"about four to-day. I overtook him\r\nin the Fulham Road, and walked with him to Lady Ashburton's door at\r\nKnightsbridge. He said, 'Browning in his young days wore a turn-down shirt\r\ncollar with a ribbon for a necktie, and a green coat. I first met him one\r\nevening at Leigh Hunt's, a modest youth, with a good strong face and a\r\nhead of dark hair. He said little, but what he said was good.'\" Possibly\r\nthe talk fell upon him because Browning was among the guests he was to\r\nmeet that day at Lady Ashburton's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORROW'S HOUSE. HEREFORD SQUARE.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris and Burne Jones lived and worked together at 17 Red Lion\r\nSquare; Steele used to live in Bloomsbury Square, where later Disraeli and\r\nhis father lived, at No. 5. George Borrow lived at 23 Hereford Square,\r\nSouth Kensington. Berkeley Square has a peculiar attraction for me, less\r\nbecause Horace Walpole had his home at 42, than because Colley Cibber\r\ndwelt as a very old man at No. 20. In the same way I am not so much drawn\r\nto Gower Street by the fact that in a greatly altered house there Darwin\r\nused to live, as I am to that shabby Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road,\r\nwhere Albert Smith had a house at which Sala once visited him. Walpole and\r\nDarwin are, of course, incomparably greater men than Cibber and Albert\r\nSmith, but these last two have a curious fascination for me. I read\r\nSmith's _Christopher Tadpole_ and _The Scattergood Family_ when I was a\r\nboy, and his figure flits elusively in the background of Dickens's\r\nreputation, wrapped in a very characteristic mid-Victorian bohemianism,\r\nand, without precisely knowing why, I have taken a sort of liking to him.\r\nSala says he was a kind, cheery little man, who when he was at work at\r\nhome wore a blue blouse. \"I recall him,\" he says, \"as a sturdy-looking,\r\nbroad-shouldered, short-necked man, with grey eyes and flowing locks of\r\nlight brown, and large side-whiskers; later in life he wore a beard. His\r\nvoice was a high treble.\" His study in Percy Street was littered always\r\nwith French novels, dolls, pipes, cheap jewellery, cakes of soap made in\r\nthe image of fruit, minature Swiss ch\u00e2lets, fancy costumes, and such a\r\nmiscellany of odds and ends that it had the appearance of an old curiosity\r\nshop. As for Cibber, I began by feeling contempt for him, because of the\r\nscorn Pope pours on him in _The Dunciad_, and the character for dulness\r\nthat was imposed upon him by that savage satirist and his host of\r\nimitators. But when I read some of Cibber's comedies (such as _The\r\nCareless Husband_, and _Love Makes a Man_) I found them amusing and clever\r\nin their fashion, certainly not dull, and when I dropped one day into the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery and saw that coloured bust of him under a glass\r\ncase and leering through the glass eyes that have been fitted into his\r\nhead--I succumbed, and acquired a sneaking regard for the gay old coxcomb\r\nthat is not yet beginning to cool. You cannot read his plays and his\r\ndelightful _Apology_ for his Life without getting interested in him; and\r\nthen if you go and look at that bust you will feel that you know the sly,\r\nwitty, shrewd, ruddy-visaged, not over clean, furtive, leery old rascal as\r\nintimately as if you had been acquainted with him in the flesh.\r\n\r\nBut if one set out to write of the homes and haunts of these minor\r\ncelebrities this book would be endless; moreover, many amongst them that\r\nhave some peculiar attraction for me might have no interest for any one\r\nelse; and many that for special reasons mean a great deal to you might\r\nmean nothing at all to me. So, as the wiser course, I have, in the main,\r\nlimited my survey to the houses of men and women who are considerable\r\nenough to be known, more or less, by every one who has even a nodding\r\nacquaintance with literature, and to that extent my chronicle is at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Addison, Joseph, 3, 28, 150, 339\r\n\r\n  Addison Bridge Place, 199, 203\r\n\r\n  Adelphi Terrace, 114, 223, 233\r\n\r\n  Ainsworth, W.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n\"Defects,\" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

If the second copy\r\nis also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\r\nopportunities to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\r\nin paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER\r\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\r\nwarranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\r\nIf any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\r\nlaw of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\r\ninterpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\r\nthe applicable state law.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
